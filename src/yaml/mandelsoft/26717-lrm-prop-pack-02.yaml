    \- LRM Prop Pack 02.dat

    Contains all descriptors for the regular streetlights.

    \- LRM\_Models\_Belgium\_WHITE.dat

    \- LRM\_Models\_Belgium\_GREY.dat

    Contains the models for the Belgian styled streetlights.

    ***NOTE:*** *Only install* ***ONE*** *of the two files. Otherwise they cause conflict with each other.*
