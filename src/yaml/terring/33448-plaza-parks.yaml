    Need to fill some gaps in your cities with something nice and simple, but you can't decide between trail paths, plazas or parks? Now you can have them all as Plaza-Parks, a new addition for your already filled parks menu ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)")

    Plaza-Parks is a collection of 28 1x1 lots that allows you to build parks and fill gaps at any shape, size and design you wish. I got this idea for the first time when I was making my lots many years ago while I was playing with some Maxis overlay textures, and finally is high time to put the idea into practice. The aim of the Plaza-Park project is to create a flexible set of small pieces, in order for you to build a huge variety of modular stand-alone parks of any size and shape you want, or to use them as fillers to fill empty spaces and separate buildings with something nice, without the need of extra custom-made textures and props, allowing all kind of players to use them, no matter what they already have (or have not) in their plugin folder. Plaza-Parks can be used to close gaps, divide structures and zones, and surround buildings like museums and bus stops, but you can also build entire parks with those pieces to give your Sims a nice place to relax. For an even better result, try mixing them with extra stuff, like playgrounds, extra plazas and whatever you have in your plugins folder. Endless compilations and building possibilities guarantee. Or your money back ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    Installation is very simple. Just unzip the .zip file into your plugins folder. Next time you check your Parks and Recreation menu you'll find them at the top of it waiting for you. There are 28 pieces, so take your time to learn them. Don't worry if you use the Uniform Street Lighting Mod, since the street lights I used doesn't affected by it, and I believe that Light Replacement Mod users will have no problem with the lights too. As about the trees, if you don't like them you can use a tree replacement mod or open the Lot Editor to customize them however you wish. Plaza-Parks uses only Maxis-made stuff, so everybody can use them. And so, no need for dependencies, right? Well, technically, Plaza-Parks does has one dependency, which is useful but fully optional. That's [SPOT (Simpeg Plop Orientation Tool)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24509-spot-simpeg-plop-orientation-tool/), a set of props that can help you find the piece you want and orient it according to your needs. Plaza-Parks will not suffer without it. You'll not get empty lots or brown boxes if you don't get SPOT, but it will save you a lot of time if you use it. The choice is your.

    Have fun ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif ":D")
