  summary: Mini Fountains
  description: |-
    I'm gonna be honest with you. I adore SimCity 4, with all of its breakthrough concepts such as the regional playing and its huge library of mods made by awesome and skilled fellas. However, as somebody who got his very first SimCity experience with SimCity 3000 back in 1999, I really miss many of the contents I still love from SC3K. One of them are the small, 1X1 fountains that you could build anywhere you want, to give your Sims a nice spot to enjoy the running water, take some nice photos, and maybe throw some pennies to make a wish. I know that SC4 has a 2X2 plaza with a fountain at its center surrounded by tall palm trees, but how about some 1X1 fountains just like in SC3K as well?

    I usually don't take requests, but [@Photovoltaic Array](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/755821-photovoltaic-array/) game me a couple of days ago the idea of creating some 1X1 fountains. I said "yeah, why not?" and I made 4 of them, all created by in-game textures and props only. That means no dependencies are required. Just download the .zip file, extract the Mini Fountains folder into your plugins folders and you're set. You'll find them sitting and being pretty into your Parks menu (obviously ![:whatevs:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_21.gif ":whatevs:") ), ready to be used as you wish. Hey, you can even mix them with my [Plaza-Parks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33448-plaza-parks/) and my [Green Plaza Modular Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35530-green-plaza-modular-set/) for extra fun, if you want. Once again, endless possibilities guarantee or your money back ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    Have fun ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif ":D")
