  summary: American Traffic Generating Lots
  description: |-
    These are a series of lots designed to simulate busy streets in your urban areas.  They are based on (and use) the lots and mod designed by Mikeseith in his European Traffic Lots.  As the name implies, these generate North American (in-game) traffic automata.  These lots create no side effects besides eye-candy traffic jams, and should be useful for creators of CJs to simulate heavier traffic in their cities.  Two versions of the mod are included, one that generates heavy traffic, and one that generates moderate traffic.  Each version retains Mike’s original lots (one grass and one plaza for each).

    Files Included:

    1x Grass Lot – Heavy Traffic – *Found in the “Parks” Menu*

    1x Grass Lot – Moderate Traffic – *Found in the “Parks” Menu*

    1x Plaza – Heavy Traffic – *Found in the “Parks” Menu*

    1x Plaza – Moderate Traffic – *Found in the “Parks” Menu*

    2x Mod/Prop files

    Dependencies:

    None.

    Installation:

    Unzip the .zip file and copy the included folder into your /MyDocuments/SimCity4/Plugins folder.

    Compatibility:

    SimCity 4: Rush Hour or SimCity 4: Deluxe is needed to use this mod.
