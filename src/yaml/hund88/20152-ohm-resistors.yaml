  description: |-
    This is my first attempt to make a more 'elaborate' building.- (With metally machinery on the side, etc.)

    This high-tec factory makes all types of resistors. From  microscopic, to  room-sized ones.

    Stats:

    \- High-tech industry

    \- needs High density zoning

    \- 129 workers

    \-low pollution
