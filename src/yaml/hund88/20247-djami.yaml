  description: |-
    This building is based on reality, (so-so).  This neat little landmark is located in Pécs, Hungary. It was originally

    a christian church, but after the Ottoman empire conquered a big chunk of Europe, It was re-built as a Mosque in 1543. Then, the Ottomans withdrew, and it was rebuilt again, to a half mosque/church. (in 1766)

    ***The lamppost is from SimGoober's mega prop set!*** ( I must have been mixed up the props

    with the originals.)
