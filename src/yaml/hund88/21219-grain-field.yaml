    Hello! I made a little something that could perk up your farm fields a bit! ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif) I think it looks better, than most grain fields i saw. The prop of plants are broken into many replicas, so that they wont look ugly on steep slopes. Plus, they blend in with each other, and with the environment.

    Whew! talking so much about a lil thing.. ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif) so anyways have fun with it!

    Ps.: Very very special thanks to    ***kd5rax*** , i learned a lot

    from his 3d upload!  Thank U! ^^
