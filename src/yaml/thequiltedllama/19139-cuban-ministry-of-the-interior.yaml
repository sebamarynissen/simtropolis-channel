    **Cuban Ministry of the Interior.**

    *By TheQuiltedLlama*

    The Cuban Ministry of the Interior is located in Havana, at the [Plaza de la Revolución](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_la_Revoluci%C3%B3n). The ministry shows the large mural, based of [Alberto Korda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Korda "Alberto Korda")'s famous photo of Ché Guevara. The text reads 'Hasta la Victoria Siempre' (Forever Onwards Towards Victory).

    This isn't an exact recreation, but is pretty close to the [real thing](http://facweb.furman.edu/~jbandelin/images/jb1003.jpg).
