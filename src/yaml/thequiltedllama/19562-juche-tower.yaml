    SMP Juche Tower

    By TheQuiltedLlama

    Thanks to Patriots for helping me out with rendering.

    Included in the Zip file there are two model files (one for the tower and one for the statue) and three Lot files. One lot is a basic lot with the tower on, one with the statue on and one containing the statue and the Tower as it is in real life.

    All the lots are Landmarks, have cost of $100 and have no other effects.

    No Dependencies.

    Description from Wikipedia:

    *The **Juche Tower** (officially the **Tower of Juche Idea**) is a [monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument "Monument") in [Pyongyang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang "Pyongyang"), [North Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"). Completed in [1982](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982 "1982"), it is sited on the eastern bank of the [River Taedong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Taedong "River Taedong"), directly opposite [Kim Il Sung Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung_Square "Kim Il Sung Square") which is situated on the other side of the river. It was made to commemorate [Kim Il Sung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung "Kim Il Sung")'s 70th birthday. It is claimed that it was designed by [Kim Jong-il](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il "Kim Jong-il").*

    *The [170metre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_E2_m "1 E2 m") (560') structure is a four sided tapering 150metre spire (the tallest one in [granite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite")) containing 25,550 blocks (365×70, one for each day of Kim Il Sung's life, excluding supplementary days), dressed in white stone with seventy dividers and capped with a 20metre high, 45ton, illuminated metal torch. It is possible to ascend the tower.*

    *Associated with the tower is a statue consisting of three figures—one with a [hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer "Hammer"), one with a [sickle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle "Sickle") and one with a writing brush (an idealised worker, a peasant and a "working [intellectual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual")"). There are six smaller groups, each 10 metres high, symbolizing other aspects of Kim Il Sung's [ideology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology"). Also close to the tower is a wall of 82 friendship plaques, apparently from foreign supporters. Around the tower there are also pavilions and water features. It is claimed that the tower has become a popular site for North Koreans.*
