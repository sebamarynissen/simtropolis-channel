    **Westgate Railway Station**

    *By TheQuitedLlama*

    This is a small railway station based on [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield_Westgate) station in Wakefield, UK. I've included two lots. One full 6x3 lot and one 6x1 lot where the station ticket hall overhangs the lot, leaving free space to use as you wish.
