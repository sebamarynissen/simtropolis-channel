    Nový zámok (literally "New Castle") is a castle and a national cultural monument. It is symbol of town Banska Stiavnica and one of two castles in this town. Nový zámok is a six-floor Renaissance building with four bastions. It was constructed in 1564-1571 as a watch tower during the [Ottoman wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93Hungarian_Wars). Because of its dominant position, it was also used as the town's live clock (exact time was announced every quarter of an hour on a trumpet). A permanent exhibition called Anti-Turkish Wars in Slovakia is installed on four floors of the castle. The highest floor offers a panoramic view of Banská Štiavnica and its environs. More information on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansk%C3%A1_%C5%A0tiavnica).
