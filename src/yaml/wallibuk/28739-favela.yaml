  summary: Favela
  description: |-
    A favela is the term for a shanty town in Brazil, most often within urban areas. Most modern favelas appeared in the 1970s due to rural exodus, when many people left rural areas of Brazil and moved to cities. About 6 percent of the population lived in slums in Brazil. This means that 11.4 million of the 190 million people that lived in the country resided in areas of irregular occupation definable by lack of public services or urbanization.  
    This BAT consists of four buildings, every growable. Add plop.
