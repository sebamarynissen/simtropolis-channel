    3 small rural churches and 1 small synagogue: cost 15000€, size 1x2:

    Catholic church in Ozdany (18. century),

    Catholic church in Jesenske (18. century),

    Reformed church in Tornala (15. century),

    Synagogue of Malacky ( end of 19.century)

    3 medium smalltown churches and 1 medium synagogue: cost 30000€, size 2x3:

    If you have any advices or problems, write them.

    I create this set because I really miss our churches from central and eastern Europe, on this website are mostly western EU or US, and my synagoues are the first in SC4 what is little bit shame after all these years.
