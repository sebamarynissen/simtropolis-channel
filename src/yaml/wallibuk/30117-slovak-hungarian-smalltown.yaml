  description: |-
    Hello, I present you my little set. This set consists of few parts. Theme of this set is again historic and from Central/ Eastern Europe. Architecture is typical for former the Kingdom of Hungaria. Nowdays, there are countries like Croatia (without Dalmatia), Serbia (North part), Transylvania (Nowdays part of Romania) and of course Slovakia and Hungaria, a similar if not identical in Czech republic (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia), Galicia (part of Poland) and maybe Austria and western Ukraine. This set consists of:

    10 small w2w townhouses,

    size: 1x2, lived RES $ 22 and landmarks, Inspire in real houses from towns Rimavska Sobota and Rožnava (Gemer)

    4 little  early medieval churches,

    size 1x1, they are landmarks and cost 5000 euros, Inspired by real churches (such as rotunda of Skalica, Kopčany and Nitra), these churches are oldest in Slovakia (9. centures to 11. century).

    System of townwall and tower,

    it consists of several walls with towers, unfortunately this townwall doesn't consists of Puzzle piecies, inspire in real townwall of towns Bardejov and Trnava.

    And of course Caste

    Every town in Slovakia needs own castle, My castly is generic Slovak/ Hungarian castle on the rock, inspire in real (unfortunately) ruins of castles Stará Lubovňa and Spišský Hrad.
