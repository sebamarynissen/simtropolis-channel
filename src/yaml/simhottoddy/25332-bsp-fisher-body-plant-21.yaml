  summary: BSP Fisher Body Plant 21
  description: |-
    Established in 1908, the Fisher Body Company's automobile bodies quickly became the industry standard.  In 1919 they built the massive Fisher Body Plant #21.  The company was sold to General Motors in 1926, and the Fisher Brothers used the proceeds of the sale to build the opulent Fisher Building in nearby New Center.  In 1984 General Motors sold the building, which was then used as a paint factory until 1993 when it closed for good

    My magnum opus, never have I poured so much sweat tears and blood into a BAT as I have for you, my beloved Fisher Body 21. Will probably be a good long time before I attempt something so big again , so you shall be unique for a while.

    Two lots, one Plopable, one growable, both 11x7

    This may take you quite a while to grow, but it *is* possible without the use of mods.
