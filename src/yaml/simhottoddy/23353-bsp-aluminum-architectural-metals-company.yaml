    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents Aluminum Architectural Metals Company!

    AAMC (because the real title is a lot to say over and over ![2.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/2.gif)) is a  warehouse located on Franklin street in Rivertown area of Detroit. This is the first building of hopefully many in my W2W industry project. Go to any old American city and you will find workshops, factories, and warehouses, not exclusively separated and detached like in SC4, but large districts that are built W2W like any other city block.

    There are four versions available: Two plopable and growable I-M lots, two with maxis job levels, two with x4 Capacity. Rendered with Trunite.

    * * *

    Included files:

    Each lot is in a clearly labeled folder, keep as many as you like.

    The x4 lots have 92 jobs and are on a 2x2 lot and is W2W (on one side).

    The "maxis jobs" lots have 23 jobs and are on a 1x2 lot and is W2W (on both sides).

    The folder labeled **Model File - REQUIRED** is required to avoid a brown box!

    Stats are included in a nifty .rtf in the download!

    * * *

    Usually I would recommend picking either the maxis jobs or the x4, but since they are on separate size lots, the choice is up to you.
