    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents Miller Street Manufacturing!

    Located on Miller Street, in between the GM-Cadillac Assembly Plant and the Detroit City Airport, Miller Street Manufacturing features a reinforced concrete frame structure with large glass window infill. This industrial typology was pioneered by Detroit architect Albert Kahn and is one of many buildings like it in the area and is typical most other American cities as well.

    There are five versions available: One landmark and two I-M growable and plopable for normal jobs and for use with the Industry Quadrupler. It is lit with Trunite and contains custom queries.

    It is recommended that you choose *either* the normal version *or* the x4 version depending on your game playing style and other mods. Installing both will cause the superfluous version to show up in game.
