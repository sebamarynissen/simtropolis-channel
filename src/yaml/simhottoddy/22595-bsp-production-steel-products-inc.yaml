    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents Production Steel Products Inc!

    Production Steel is a  warehouse located on Beaufait street in Detroit, but is only one of many similar buildings across the area and is typical most other American cities as well.

    There are five versions available: One landmark and two I-M growable and plopable for normal jobs and for use with the Industry Quadrupler. Is lit with Trunite.

    * * *

    Files Included:

    **I-m3\_2x6\_ProductionSteel.dat**

    Contains normal growable lot with 46 jobs

    I-m\_2x6\_ProductionSteel\_PLOP.dat

    Contains normal plopable lot with 46 jobs

    **I-m3\_2x6\_ProductionSteel\_X4.dat**

    Contains x4 growable lot with 184 jobs

    **I-m\_2x6\_ProductionSteel\_PLOP\_X4.dat**

    **LM6x2\_ProductionSteel.SC4Lot**

    **Production\_Steel\_Products.SC4Model** Required to avoid brown box!

    All lots are 6x2

    It is recommended that you choose *either* the normal version *or* the x4 version depending on your gameplaying style and other mods. Installing both will cause the superfluous version to show up in game.
