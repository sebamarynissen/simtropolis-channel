  summary: Pripiat Long Block V1 (Dark Nite)
  description: |-
    Located in the abandoned city of Pripiat, Ukraine, these 5 story apartment buildings compose several of the city's "microdistricts". At the time, they were very desirable places to live, however if you want to make them live up to their irradiated reputation, a R$ version is included.

    They were built in a common style of the period, so numerous similar (or even identical) blocks can be found throughout Europe. There are a few other variations I have in the works, hence the V1. Rendered with Trunite [Dark Nite](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=23089) because Simfox bugged me when I released the original.

    [Here is a full size view of the two Lots](http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2145/newcityjan1200126422529.png). (.png warning)

    **This upload includes:**

    2 7x1 growables, one R$ and one R$$

    2 8x2 growables, one R$ and one R$$

    Might take a few tries to get these to grow, just be patient or use "[buildinplop](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=21118)" on a *pre-developed* residential zone (or series of zones that add up to) of the *same size*. Failure to follow that rule will result in abandonment.

    **Installation**:

    Unzip the contents directly into the Plugins folder. If you do not want a particular version, simply remove the corresponding folder from your plugins.

    **Pripiat\_Long\_block\_v1-0x5ad0e817\_0x79fdbebd\_0x30000.SC4Model** MUST be included to avoid a brown box!

    If you have the regular Maxis Nite version, it is recommended that you remove it.

    **Stats**:

    R$$ Occupants: 652

    R$ Occupants: 1128

    Style: Euro

    Stage: 7

    Other stats: FYI, it is not irradiated. ![2.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/2.gif)

    **Dependencies:**

    [SimFox's Day 'n' Nite Modd](../../stex/details.cfm?id=23089) is required.

    Modeling by Simhottoddy.

    Loting by Jasoncw.

    Modding by Nofunk.

    Special thanks to everyone in my [BAT thread](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=37&threadid=103005&enterthread=y) that contributed to making these better!

    Enjoy!
