    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents Detroit Elevator Company!

    The Detroit Elevator Company building, located at 1938 Franklin street in the heart of Rivertown, was known as The F. Joseph Lamb Co. tool and die shop (typical of the area) until 1929 when it was purchased by the DEC. The company was, and remains to be, a family-owned business, now run by a third generation son. His grandfather worked for DEC before purchasing it from the original owners in the early 40's. Although this particular building is no longer in use by the company, the DEC still operates in an inconspicuous facility in Ferndale MI and is one of the only independent elevator companies still in business. As of 2010, the building is being converted in to a small business incubator similar to the Russell Industrial Center.

    There are four versions available: two I-M growables and two I-M plopables for normal jobs and for use with the Industry Quadrupler. All lots are 3x2 and are W2W on both sides.

    Maxis Job versions have 58 jobs.

    x4 versions have 232 jobs.

    Lit with Trunite. I'm going to try to get a dark night version up soon, same goes for my other works if possible.

    * * *

    Files are neatly organized with their functions in the filename, simply remove the ones you do not want, however you MUST keep the folder labeled **Model File --** **REQUIRED**, least yea meet the monstrous *brown box!*

    It is recommended that you choose *either* the normal version *or* the x4 version depending on your game playing style and other mods. Installing both will cause the superfluous version to show up in game.
