  summary: Pulkovo airport from SBU CJ
  description: |-
    I have been asked a few times to supply this model in the past. I finally found the motivation to dig it out of my plugins folder.

    **THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A LOT! .sc4model only!**

    This is the model only. I have neither the game nor any of the modding tools installed at this point so you will have to do the modding and make the lot yourself. Sorry! The images show what I cooked up... **8 years ago?!?** Jeez, I can't believe it has been so long. I have a full time job and another hobby that eats most of my free time, but I miss all of you that made SC4 fun for as long as I was active. ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif "*:)")
