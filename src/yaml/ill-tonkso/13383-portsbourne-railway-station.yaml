    **Portsbourne Railway Station**

    This Station was originally intended only for my CJ but i am releasing on Popular Demand. It is a victorian themed station, it has 4 platforms set into a terminus. The two story ticket hall has a Stained Glass window with the Southern Railway logo.

    It has a capacity of 20,000 passengers and has Transit Enabled Road and Rail, the Road allows traffic to run right through the lot at three entry points.
