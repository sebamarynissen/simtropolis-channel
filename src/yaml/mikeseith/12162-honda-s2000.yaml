  summary: Honda S2000 Automata
  description: |-
    Another car to run in your cities.  This is a Honda S2000 sports car.  It comes in 7 colors:

    orange, blue, green, white, silver, red, yellow.

    These cars do not replace any automata.  They are wealth $$ (medium).

    Special thanks to Swamper77 for helping me improve these cars. They now have the correct model name in the tool-tip for UDI mode thanks to Swamper77.
