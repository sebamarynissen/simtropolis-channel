  description: |-
    **These are the long promised Citroen dealerships.**  

      

    * * *

    The file includes 2 growable and 1 ploppable lots, 38 new Citroen vehicle automata (the cars that drive around your city) and 57 family props(the cars that park at your buildings in your city).  
      
    The lots spawn Citroen automata like all of my recent lots (many thanks to Swamper77 for LUA file knowledge).  
      
    The automata have headlights and taillights that are custom fitted to the vehicles, not just trying to make the Maxis default lights work on them.  This is something new for me in this upload.  

    * * *

      
    go [here](http://www.props.freeservers.com/citroen.htm) to see more pictures of the automata and the lots.

    like all of my stuff, just place all the files into the game's plugin folder.
