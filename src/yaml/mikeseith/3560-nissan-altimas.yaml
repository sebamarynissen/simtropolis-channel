  description: |-
    Add more veriety to that traffic in your cities. 4 Nissan Altimas in yellow, brown, green and blue. They are new instances of $$ wealth traffic. Just drop the .dat files in your plugin directory and watch them go, or have your sims drive thema round.

    for more traffic veriety visit props.freeservers.com

    and download the 19 other driveable vehicles there.

    I am going away on a short vacation soon and after I get back I'll begin work on a simple tutorial explaining how I make driveable vehicles. I have recieved a few requests for one so I'll give it a try...

    happy cruising and obey the speed limits.
