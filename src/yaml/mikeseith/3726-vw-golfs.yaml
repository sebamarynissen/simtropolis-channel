  summary: Driveable VW Golfs Tutorial cars
  description: |-
    4 V.W. Golfs for you to let loose in your cities. I have a tutorial on my site at:

    props.freeservers.com

    This is a tutorial on making vehicle automata for SC4. It is my 1st ever tutorial so please have patience.

    I look forward to downloading many great vehicles from this site in the weeks ahead (if anyone can figure out my tutorial)

    good luck and have fun!
