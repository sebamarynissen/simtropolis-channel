#   description: |-
#     **The Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep Dealership and Automata**

#     **the zip file includes 2 install programs.**

#     **1 is the main files and the other includes needed textures and family props.**

#     **This dealership has family props for the lot cars for less repetition. These vehicles (automata) act like their Maxis counterparts in game. For example, the Grand Caravan shows up at your schools like the minivan and the Challenger is real fast like the high wealth sports car.**

#     **The large landmark dealership has 58 jobs. The small growable dealerships have 25 jobs.**

#     **Enjoy**

#     **Fixed the pathing in the installer 08-05-12 09:00 PM**

#     **Uploaded the newest version with the forgotten automata 08-07-12 04:20 PM**

#     **Sorry for any problems.**
