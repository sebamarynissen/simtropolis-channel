  summary: Volvo S40 and V70 wagon family props
  description: |-
    Tired of your sims driving my automata (cars) around your cities andnever parking?  Well here is the answer.  These are highwealth family props.  No need to place them on a lot for them towork.  Most residential lots have a family prop ready to go.

    Just unzip the files into your game's plugin folder and sit back andwait.  It takes awhile for them to show up in front of a few ofyour high wealth houses.

    Look for more single family props and some family prop clusters soon.
