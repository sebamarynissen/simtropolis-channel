  summary: Nissan Dealership
  description: |-
    A set of growable Nissan Dealers.

    Comes with all props.

    Download all of my Nissan cars (Pathfinder, Maxima, Altima, Frontier and 350z). All of the lot props were made using the models of these cars so they look like they drove right off the dealership lot.

    Includes one ploppable lot found in the landmarks menu. the name of the file is "Main Street Nissan Plop"
