  summary: Nissan Pathfinders automata
  description: |-
    Some Nissan Pathfinder SUVs for your cities. Just place the unzipped files into your game's plugin folder and watch them go.

    Goes great with my Nissan Dealership.

    NOTE: If you downloaded my Nissan Pathfinders from my site at www.props.freeservers.com you may still want to overwrite the old files from there. These files have much nicer my sim you drive it icons.
