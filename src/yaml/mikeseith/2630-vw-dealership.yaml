#   summary: Volkswagen VW Dealership
#   description: |-
#     This is a VW Dealership for a crowded city. It has a 3 level garage for all the new cars and a repair garage next to it. This lot just looks nice, I am no good at any of the modding stuff. If anyone wants to spend the time making this lot more useable instead of just being eyecandy, be my guest and fiddle with it and upload the improved lot with my blessing.

#     When I made the ploppable VW dealer there were lots of comments from folks wanting a growable version, so here it is in 3 lots. As always, this lot is full of props you can use on your lots.
