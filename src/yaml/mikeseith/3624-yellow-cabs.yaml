  summary: Yellow Cabs
  description: |-
    2 sets of cabs. 1 set to replace the game default cabs and 1 set of additional taxis. All are of ford crown victorias, except 1 taxi is a windstar van. Now all of the cabs in your city can be that familiar yellow color. Unfortunatly until I can figure out how to import new 3d models into the game I won't be able to make any of those London cabs.

    the taxis to replace the default are named:

    taxi yellow crown vic a

    taxi yellow crown vic b

    taxi yellow crown vic c

    the extra instance taxis are named:

    taxi extra crown vic a

    taxi extra crown vic b

    taxi extra crown vic c

    taxi extra crown vic d

    taxi van

    as always place the files you want in the plugins folder

    coming soon to a city near you...Checker cabs
