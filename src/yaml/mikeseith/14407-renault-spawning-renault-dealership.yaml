  summary: Renault spawning Renault dealership
  description: |-
    **New Renault dealerships for your cities**

    These new dealerships are ploppable and growable... please place all files into the game's Plugins folder.

    These dealerships are unlike any of my others... they all spawn Renault vehicles. The ploppable dealerships also send out a bunch of Renault when you plop them (think of it as a grand opening sale).

    I'd like to thank Swamper77 and all of the BSC for helping me with recent efforts. Without Swamper77's help with LUA files, this would be a much more boring BAT.

    Although I am not a fan of dependencies, this file has one right here: [**European cars new instances**](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/14400-european-cars-automata-and-family-props-new-instances/)

    *It is very important to have this in order to spawn the vehicles.*
