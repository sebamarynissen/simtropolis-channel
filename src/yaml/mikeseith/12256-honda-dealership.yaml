  summary: Honda Dealership (growable and landmark)
  description: |-
    The zip contains 90 files so do not be alarmed.  Most of the files are for the props and need to be installed.  There are 4 files containing the growable lots and they are all named CS$$1\_2x3Park Honda1\_ef6c5c3a

    CS$$1\_3x3Park Honda 2\_2f6c5e3e

    CS$$1\_3x3Park Honda 4\_ef6c6dce

    CS$$1\_3x4Park Honda 3\_ef6c6a97

    And there is one landmark lot named

    LM5x4\_Honda Dealership Large\_cf6c03a4

    You can put either the growable or the landmark lots in your Plugins folder, or you can put both types in.

    I used the 3d models of all of the Honda automata that has been uploaded by me at Simtropolis in the dealership so the cars on the lot match my Honda automata exactly.

    Dialup users beware. The file is 1.6 megs.  
    ^ **Staff Note:** Hopefully this doesn't apply to many in 2022 and beyond!
