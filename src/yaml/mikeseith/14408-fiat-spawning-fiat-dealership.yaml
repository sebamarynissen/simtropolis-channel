  summary: Fiat spawning Fiat dealership
  description: |-
    **New Fiat dealerships for your cities**

    These new dealerships are ploppable and growable...please place all files into your game's plugin folder.

    These dealerships are just like my Renault dealerships except these dealerships spawn Fiats. The ploppable dealerships also send out a bunch of Fiats when you plop them (think of it as a grand opening sale for your Sims).  
      
    The evils of dependencies again rears its ugly head... in order to make these dealerships spawn Fiats **you need this file**... **[European cars new instances](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/14400-european-cars-automata-and-family-props-new-instances/)**
