  description: |-
    As promised, Checker cabs for your big cities.

    Replaces original taxis in the game:

    taxi yellow checker a

    taxi yellow checker b

    taxi yellow checker c

    Additional instances of checker taxis:

    taxi extra checker a

    taxi extra checker b

    taxi extra checker c

    taxi extra checker d

    taxi extra checker e

    taxi extra checker f

    taxi extra checker g

    taxi extra checker h

    Note: you can only replace the originals with either the checkers or the crown vics. you can however use all of the extra checkers and extra crown victorias at the same time.

    The tutorial on driveable SC4 vehicles will be put on the exchange very soon. Its almost done.
