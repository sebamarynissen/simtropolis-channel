    Dig it.

    Send your cities back to the 1960s with my newest automata set.  Forget the Assasinations, civil unrest and veitnam.  Just concentrate on how groovy those cars from the 60s look.  These are cars from the peak of the American automotive industry (in my humble opinion).  Believe it or not, I worked on this modd on and off for three years.  Now for the info.

    Peace

    This mod contains 121 UDI drivable cars for your cities and 120 commercial and residential car clusters.  All cars have custom night lighting.

    Just unzip

    60s family props.dat     - This is the file with the cars that are parked in front of houses and buildings in your city

    and

    1960s Maxis cars replacement mod.dat     -This is the file with the UDI drivable automata

    **No dependencies needed**

    Files that you might consider downloading also:
