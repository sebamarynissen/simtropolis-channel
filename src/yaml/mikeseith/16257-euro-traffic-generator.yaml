  description: |-
    These lots spawn automata from the [**European auto new instance mod**](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/14400-european-cars-automata-and-family-props-new-instances/).

    **They** **must** be installed with this lot. Otherwise, these lots will not spawn anything. When plopped, these lots spawn many European cars onto your city's streets. These lots are intended to be a help for people creating C.J.s and people who want to create a little gridlock and spectacular crashes. These lots will also spawn Citroens from my newest Citroen dealer when it comes out in the next few weeks.

    Attempted to minimize the "flashing" effect of the lots.

    **Please note: If you already have the European auto new instance mod you will have to redownload it and have it overwrite the older version.**

    These lots can be found in the parks menu and are labelled as Euro traffic generator.

    As always, place these files and the European auto new instance mod in the game's plugin folder.

    Updated June 27, 2006 to include:

    -   1 grassy lot generating moderate traffic.

    -   1 grassy lot generating heavy traffic.
