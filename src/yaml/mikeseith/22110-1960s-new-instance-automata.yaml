  summary: 1960s New Instance UDI Automata
  description: |-
    Dig it.

    Send your cities back to the 1960s with my newest automata set.  Forget the Assasinations, civil unrest and veitnam.  Just concentrate on how groovy those cars from the 60s look.  These are cars from the peak of the American automotive industry (in my humble opinion).  Believe it or not, I worked on this modd on and off for three years.  Now for the info.

    Peace

    This mod contains 121 UDI drivable cars for your cities and 120 commercial and residential car clusters.  All cars have custom night lighting.

    This file is different from my [1960s Maxis Automata Replacement Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22109-1960s-maxis-automata-replacement-modd/) in the following ways:

    \- All the cars in this mod are new instances.  They do not replace any Maxis automata.

    \- You can install all the Automata files in 1 file or install only the cars you want from the list.

    to install all 121 cars Just unzip

    60s family props.dat     - This is the file with the cars that are parked in front of houses and buildings in your city

    and

    1960s new instance ALL cars mod.dat     -This is the file with all 121 of the UDI drivable automata.

    * * *

    or if you want to only install certain models just pick the files with the cars you want in the game and place them in the plupins folder

    **No dependencies needed**

    Files that you might consider downloading also:
