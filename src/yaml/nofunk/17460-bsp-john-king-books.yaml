  summary: BSP John King Books
  description: |-
    **Overview**  
      
    In 1971, John King established his first used bookstore in the Michigan Theatre building in downtown Detroit. Twelve years later and bursting at the seams with books, John bought the old Advance Glove factory at 901 W. Lafayette. Since then, John King Used & Rare Books has expanded to occupy all four floors plus the basement of the old factory (John makes his home in a corner of the 4th floor) as well as the Otis Elevator building next door! Today, John King Books is a Detroit landmark and is frequented by everyone from local sports stars and politicos to celebrities like Jay Leno and magicians Penn & Teller. **This** **is a faithful re-creation of the actual building**: the only liberties taken have been with the lot design.

    For SimCity4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It does notmatter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    In total, the following versions are available:

    -   Ploppable landmark
    -   Ploppable functional CS$
    -   Growable CS$ building
    -   Growable I-M building\*\*

    \*\*Will grow as “Advance Glove Manufacturing,” the original name of the building.  
      
    Note:Both ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. Moreover, both ploppable versions are to be found conveniently grouped together near the center of your landmark menu.
