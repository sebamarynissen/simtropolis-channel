  summary: BSP Hamilton Avenue Shops
  description: |-
    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents the Hamilton Avenue Shops!

    During Detroit's heyday, Highland Park was an upscale enclave, filled with grand houses and thriving businesses. Although the city has suffered from the same challenges as Detroit which surrounds it, glimpses of Highland Park's great history can be seen in these Hamilton Avenue businesses.

    Three different models are offered in this pack and for each there is a growable and a ploppable version, for a total of six lots! All lots provide low wealth commercial services jobs.

    Note: All ploppable versions feature custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmark menu.
