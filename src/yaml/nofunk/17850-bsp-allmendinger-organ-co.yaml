  summary: BSP Allmendinger Organ Co
  description: |-
    **Introduction ----------**

    The Allmendinger Organ Company was founded in 1872 by David F. Allmendinger. Standing at the corner of Washington and First Streets in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the present structure was built in four phases between 1895 and 1911. At its height, the factory produced 5,000 organs and 600 pianos a year. The building still stands and is now known as the Benz Building. **This is a faithful re-creation of the actual building.  
    **  
    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    I have offered this building in two versions: a light brick model and a dark brick model. Both are clearly marked in the .zip file along with images from the game to help you choose which you want installed. You can use both, of course, but keep in mind that you will have four ploppable versions in your landmarks menu and six growable versions! Each brick model has the following available:  
      
    \+ Ploppable Landmark  
    \+ Ploppable functional CS§§§  
    \+ Growable CS§§§  
    \+ Growable R§§ \*  
    \+ Growable I-m (manufacturing)  
      
    \* Will grow as the "Benz Building."
