    **Introduction --**

    HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

    The McNamara Federal Building in Detroit, Michigan is named after late Michigan Senator Patrick V. McNamara. The 27-story tower was built in 1976 and was designed in the brutalist architectural style, with concrete as its featured material. The building's primary use is as a government building, but also contains some private business offices.

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are available:

    • Ploppable landmark

    • Ploppable functional medium-wealth commercial office

    • Growable medium-wealth commercial office

    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmark menu.

    **ALSO! This BAT features both German and Spanish compatibility!**

    Version Information --

    There are three versions available, all on 5x5 lots. All growable versions will appear in the Houston and Euro tilesets.

    Installation --

    First of all, I recommend you unzip the entire contents of this .zip into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to rebuild your plugins from scratch.

    That said, in order to use this building in game, I suggest you first go to your plugins folder and make a sub-folder for this download. Then, simply copy the McNamara\_Fed\_Bldg.dat file (the actual building model) plus the
