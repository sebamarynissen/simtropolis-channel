  summary: BSP Maccabees Building
  description: |-
    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents the Maccabees Building!

    The Maccabees Building is a commercial building located in midtown Detroit, Michigan, on what is now the campus of Wayne State University. Construction began in 1926 and ended one year later. Originally built for the fraternal organization the Knights of the Maccabees, it was later used as studio space for Detroit's budding media companies. The "Lone Ranger" radio show debuted and was broadcast from the building in 1933.

    The building features an 82 meter radio tower on top. ([See a zoom 5 preview of the building with radio tower](http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3095/macantenna.jpg).) For SimCity4, I also offer a version without the spire.

    There are five versions available, three with the antenna, and two without. All versions are on 3x4 lots.
