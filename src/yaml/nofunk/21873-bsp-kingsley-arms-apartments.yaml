    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents the Kingsley Arms Apartments!

    The Kingsley Arms Apartments was constructed in 1929 in Ann Arbor, Michigan's historic Fourth Ward. Designed by architect G. S. Gerganoff in the moorish style, this building has served as housing for many medical students and nurses due to its proximity to the University of Michigan's medical campus.

    Although in real life the building is strictly medium wealth, I felt it looked more "ritzy" so have made it a high wealth residential buidling for the game.

    There are three versions available: two residential versions and one landmark.
