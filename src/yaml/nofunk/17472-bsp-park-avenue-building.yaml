  summary: BSP Park Avenue Building

    **Overview**  
      
    The Park Avenue Building stands at the corner of Adams and Park Avenues in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Constructed in 1923, it once housed the offices of local workers' unions. Next to it stands the Park Apartments, a 14-story low-rent tower. The two are not a natural pairing, but years of demolition have left them alone together on the west side of Grand Circus Park. (See reference photo [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/allanm/16793537/in/set-343592/); [another one](http://detroit1701.org/Graphics/Park%20Avenue%20Building.jpg)).

    The Park Avenue Building is currently abandoned, but there are plans for renovation. Unfortunately, like so many good plans in the City of Detroit, there is no guarantee that they will come to fruition and this beautiful building will be saved. **This is a faithful re-creation of the actual buildings.** The only exceptions to this are the props used to decorate the lots, and the interior walls of the free-standing, growable versions of each building.

    For SimCity4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so. (Although, if you use them all, you will see these buildings quite often given the right demand!)

    In total, the following **six** versions are available:

    -   Ploppable landmark Park Apartments & Park Ave Building
    -   Ploppable functional CO§§ Park Apartments & Park Ave Building
    -   Growable CO§§ Park Apartments & Park Ave Building
    -   Growable R§ Park Apartments & Park Ave Building
    -   Growable CO§§ Park Ave Building (free-standing)
    -   Growable R§ Park Apartments (free-standing)

    Note: Both ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. Moreover, both ploppable versions are to be found conveniently grouped together near the center of your landmark menu.
