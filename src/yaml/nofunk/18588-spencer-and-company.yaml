    **Introduction:  
    **  
    Spencer & Co is a beautiful mid-rise commercial office building with late art deco stylings.  
      
    Due to its awkward dimensions, I couldn’t do much of anything fancy when lotting it. However, the east and north walls are situated to be wall-to-wall compatible, making the building useful as a cap to narrow blocks.  
      
    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    The following versions are available:  
      
    • Ploppable landmark  
    • Growable high wealth commercial office (CO$$$)  
    • Ploppable high wealth commercial office (CO$$$)  
      
    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmarks menu.  
      
    **Version Information:  
    **  
    There are three versions available, all on 2x3 lots. All growable versions will appear in the New York and Houston tilesets.
