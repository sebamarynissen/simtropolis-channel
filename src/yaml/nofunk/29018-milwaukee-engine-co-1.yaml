    The Milwaukee Engine Co. #1 is an Art Deco fire station located in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Compact and wall-to-wall, this little urban fire station is a great way to provide fire protection in your denser SimCity neighborhoods.

    -   This is a 1x3, wall-to-wall fire station and costs ยง150 per month.
    -   Provides 2 dispatches for a radius slightly larger than the Maxis small fire station.
    -   Available in both MaxisNite and DarkNite.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
