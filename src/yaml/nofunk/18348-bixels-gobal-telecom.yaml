    Introduction --

    Bixel has graced us with yet another fantastic modern, Asian-style BAT. Gobal Telecom is a CS§ building that will provide 1,430 jobs for your city. In addition, this corner building has been situated on its lots to offer **Wall-to-Wall functionality** in two directions.

    But that’s not all! Also included is a lot that can be placed up against an angled road!

    Note on the angled lot: In order for the building to fit properly in an angled space, it has been placed on a 2x2 lot. This means the building overhangs the lot in two directions. To place the building, simply choose a spot bordered by roads (see the reference image included in the download) and then use the Home key to rotate the building into the appropriate position and plop! There will remain two single tiles open on either corner of the building; you may wish to use the generic Open Paved Area lot in the Parks menu to fill these spaces.

    The following versions are included:

    -   Growable CS$ (regular lot)
    -   Ploppable functional CS$ (regular lot)
    -   Ploppable functional CS$ (overhanging lot for angled roads)

    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the top of your Landmark menu.

    **At a Glance --**

    The growable will grow in the Houston tileset only. Complete stats and values available in the readme.

    **Dependencies --**

    You must leave the file Gobal\_Telecom\_MODEL.dat in your Plugins folder, along with at least one of the accompanying folders in order for this BAT to work in the game.

    **Props:**  none!

    **Textures:**  none!

    **Installation --**

    First of all, it is recommended to unzip the entire contents of this ZIP into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to download all plugins ane
