  summary: Third Ward Lofts I
  description: |-
    **Introduction / Overview**  
      
    Do you long to create vibrant, URBAN downtowns? Are you frustrated by the lack of truly urban Maxis buildings? Do you want to add a sense of history to your city centers? Well look no further! Inspired by the old warehouses of Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s 3rd ward, the Third Ward Lofts will add density and history to any urban neighborhood.  
      
    **Third Ward Lofts I** is the first in an upcoming set of warehouse style commercial and residential buildings I will be designing and releasing. (At least, that is my plan!)  
      
    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    The following versions are included:  
      
    •Ploppable landmark\*  
    •Ploppable functional CO§§  
    •Growable CO§§  
    •Growable R§§  
      
    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. Both ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmarks menu.

    \*The landmark version has a monthly cost of §25 for historic preservation but also gives you a small mayor rating for being such a good guy and preserving great old buildings!

    All lots are 2x2 and grow in the Chicago tileset only. Full stats and values are available in the readme.

    First of all, it is recommended to unzip the entire contents of this ZIP into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the
