  summary: Clock Shadow Building
  description: |-
    Completed in 2012, the Clock Shadow Building is a new mixed-use building in Milwaukee's historic Walker's Point neighborhood. A model in sustainability, the building was constructed on a former brownfield site using salvaged materials and boasts features that are energy and water efficient as well as a vegetated roof.

    Due to its green features, power and water consumption are half that of a typical Maxis building its size and pollution is reduced as well.

    Add a little something green to your city today with the Clock Shadow Building!

    -   This is a 1x3, stage 5 Cs$$$ for the Euro tileset that provides 34 jobs.
    -   Available in both MaxisNite and DarkNite.
