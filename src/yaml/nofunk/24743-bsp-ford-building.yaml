  summary: BSP Ford Building
  description: |-
    Designed by Daniel Burnham, the Ford Building was one of Detroit's earliest skyscrapers, and the tallest building in Detroit from its completion in 1909 until 1913. The building's name isn't connected to Henry Ford or the Ford Motor Company. Rather, it was constructed as the headquarters for the Edward Ford Plate Glass Company. But the building's most famous tennant was Sanders, a legendary Detroit ice cream and candy company which operated a store on the ground floor from the 1920s to the early 1990s.

    There are two versions available:  
      
    • Ploppable high-wealth commercial office  
    • Growable high-wealth commercial office  
      
    ***\*\* A DarkNite version of the Ford Building will be released immediately after this!***
