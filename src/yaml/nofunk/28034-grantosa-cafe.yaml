  summary: Grantosa Cafe
  description: |-
    The Grantosa Cafe is a fictional business that is housed in a real building from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Located at 826 N. Plankinton Avenue in downtown Milwaukee, the Grantosa Cafe offers you an upscale dining experience in a beautifully restored historic building. The Grantosa Cafe is wall-to-wall to the west, and has a charming seating area in an alleyway to the east. This BAT works best with another wall-to-wall building on the west, and a small street or alley on the east, but it can also work in the middle of a wall-to-wall block.
