    “Well it’s 1 2 3 4 take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba I’ll be glad to see you later…”

    Located at 4020 Lafayette Blvd in Detroit’s Hubbard Farms neighborhood, the Hotel Yorba stands as a symbol of Detroit’s glorious past and challenging present. Originally built in 1926 as a residential hotel for retirees with a taste for housekeeping and room service, it now serves largely as a flophouse, offering short-term stays for unsavory customers.

    Visible from I-75, the building with its iconic sign has been a Detroit landmark, even before being memorialized by Detroit garage rock band, the White Stripes.

    -   4x2 growable and ploppable CS$ lots.  
         
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).  
         
    -   Requires [mipro essentials January 2019](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29130-mipro-essentials/) or newer.

    **Installation Instructions:**

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version. If you change your mind, you can switch between DN and MN versions by swapping out the .SC4Model files.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.
    3.  .SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
