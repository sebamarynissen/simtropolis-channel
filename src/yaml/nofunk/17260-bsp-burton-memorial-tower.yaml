    **OVERVIEW**

    Built in 1936 and designed by architect Albert Kahn, the Burton Memorial Tower stands 212 feet (73 meters) above the main campus of the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. Its bell tower houses the 43-ton Charles Baird Carillon -- the fourth heaviest musical instrument in the world! **This is a faithful recreation of the actual building**: the only liberties taken have been with the lot design of the educational building.

    For SimCity4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you would like to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use both simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are available:

    -   Landmark
    -   College

    *Note: The landmark lot will appear in your landmarks menu, while the college lot will appear in your education menu.*
