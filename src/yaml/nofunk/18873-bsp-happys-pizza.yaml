    **Introduction --**

    **HAPPY HALLOWEEN!**

    Happy’s Pizza is a local Detroit restaurant chain with a number of locations throughout the metro area. Known for chicken wings and fried shrimp as well as its pizza, Happy’s is the perfect place to grab a few pounds of fried food after a busy day in the Motor City.

    Like the [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntMgpdUFa3w) says: “When you’re hungry real hungry for some yummy food, shout out to Happy’s ‘cause it’s all good!”

    This particularly gritty version of Happy’s is located on Morang Drive on Detroit’s east side.

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in two versions. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use both of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are available:

    • Ploppable low-wealth commercial services

    • Growable low-wealth commercial services

    Note: The ploppable version features an individual custom menu icon that will allow you to locate it easily in your Landmarks menu. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmark menu.

    **Version Information --**

    There are two versions available, both on 1x2 lots.

    **Dependencies --**

    There are **NO** external dependencies for this BAT!

    **Installation --**

    First of all, I recommend you unzip the entire contents of this .zip into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to rebuild your plugins from scratch.

    That said, in order to use this building in game, I suggest you first go to your plugins folder and make a sub-folder for this download. Then, simply copy the Happys\_Pizza\_MODEL.SC4Model file (the actual building model) plus the lot file(s) of whatever version(s) you'd like to use into the newly created sub-folder.

    Of course, you can also choose the opposite approach, i.e. unzip everything into your plugins folder and simply delete or move out all versions you don't want to use.

    Remember that the screenshots and this readme are not needed by the game, but it is a good idea to store them somewhere.

    To uninstall a version you don't like, first bulldoze all instances of that version in your cities, then save the cities and
