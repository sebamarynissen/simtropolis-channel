    The Centre Building stands at 212 W. Wisconsin Avenue in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Originally opened as the Grand Warner Theatre in 1931, the 12-story Art Deco office tower is now home to the Center Theatre Corporation and the Downtown Milwaukee visitor center. Its elaborate trompe l'oeil mural on the east wall makes it a landmark on the city's Wisconsin Avenue corridor.
