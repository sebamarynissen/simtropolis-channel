  summary: BSP Park Shelton Hotel
  description: |-
    The **Barry Sanders Project** presents the Park Shelton Hotel!

    The Park Shelton, originally named The Wardell, was built in 1927 at the corner of Woodward and Kirby in midtown Detroit, Michigan. It was home to artist Diego Rivera while he worked on his mural at the Detroit Institute of Arts, and was the hotel of choice for celebrities such as Bob Hope, Gracie Allen and George Burns when they visited the city.

    In 2004 the building was completely refurbished and converted into luxury condominiums.

    There are four versions available:

    • Growable R$$$ (Park Shelton Condominiums)

    • Growable CS$$$ (Park Shelton Hotel)

    • Ploppable CS$$$ (Park Shelton Hotel)

    • Landmark ("The Park Shelton")
