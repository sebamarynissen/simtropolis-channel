  summary: Main Street Shops
  description: |-
    Do you long to create vibrant, URBAN downtowns? Are you frustrated by the lack of truly urban Maxis buildings? Do you want to add a sense of history to your city centers? Well look no further! Inspired by the old warehouse buildings of Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s Old Third ward, the Main Street Shops will add density and history to your downtown. (Truth be told, these were more inspired by a recent trip to Cincinnati, Ohio, but they still fit the theme!)

    Main Street Shops is the second in a set of warehouse style commercial and residential buildings.

    A note on placement: This lot can function in any configuration! It was designed to be **wall-to-wall**, but looks just as good as a stand-alone structure. (The right side is a corner building; the left side has an interesting advertisement.)

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are included:

    • Ploppable landmark\*

    • Ploppable functional CO§§

    • Growable CO§§

    • Ploppable functional CS§§

    • Growable CS§§

    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmark menu.

    \*The landmark version has a monthly cost of §50 for historic preservation but also gives you a small mayor rating for being such a good mayor and preserving great old buildings!

    **At a Glance**

    All lots are 4x2 and grow in the Chicago tileset only. Complete values are available in the readme.

    **Dependencies**

    Main\_Street\_Shops.SC4Model (included in the download!!) is required for the buildings to appear in the game.

    There are no other dependencies!

    **Installation**

    First of all, it is recommended to unzip the entire contents of this ZIP into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply c
