    **Introduction**

    The Barry Sanders Project presents the Hofmann Building.

    The Hofmann Building used to stand at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Sibley Street in Detroit, Michigan. Sadly, in the 1970s the Hofmann's cornice and much of its beautiful Gothic ornamentation were removed. By the time it was finally demolished in the 1980s, the building was virtually unrecognizable from Louis Kamper's original design.

    This building stands on a corner lot and is **wall-to-wall** in TWO directions.

    The following versions are available:

    • Ploppable landmark

    • Ploppable functional medium-wealth commercial offices

    • Growable medium-wealth commercial offices

    **At a Glance**

    There are three versions available, all on 1x2 lots.
