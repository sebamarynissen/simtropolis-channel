  description: |-
    An old favorite comes back with fresh textures and DarkNite compatibility!

    The Bronx County Courthouse (now known as the Mario Merola Building) was built in 1933 and has been called a prime example of "Twentieth Century American style."

    This building is a 6x6 reward lot. It will appear in your Rewards menu and will be available once your city and region have met certain requirements.

    -   6x6 reward lot  
        
    -   Available in both MaxisNite and DarkNite  
        
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)  
        
    -   Readme included. No dependencies!
