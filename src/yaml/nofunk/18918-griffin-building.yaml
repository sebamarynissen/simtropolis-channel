    **Introduction --**

    The classic Griffin Building, with its orange limestone façade and copper-detailed cornice, will add a high-class flourish to any downtown!

    This building sits on a corner lot and is **wall-to-wall in two directions**!  Intended for use in dense downtowns and with my previous “Views from the Third Ward” releases. Add the Griffin Building to your city today!

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are available:

    •    Ploppable landmark

    •    Ploppable functional high-wealth commercial

    •    Growable high-wealth commercial

    •    Ploppable functional medium-wealth commercial

    •    Growable medium-wealth commercial

    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmarks menu.

    Version Information --

    There are FIVE versions available, all on 2x2 lots. Growable versions appear in the Chicago and New York tilesets.

    **Installation --**

    First of all, I recommend you unzip the entire contents of this .zip into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff
