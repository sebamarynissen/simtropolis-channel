    **UPDATE: A small error was found with the** **CS****§****§****§ Ploppable** **version of this model. The custom menu icon did not save properly to the lot file, so the original upload will show a blank space in your Landmarks menu.  
      
    Note: this a cosmetic problem ONLY and will NOT affect game play. This ONLY involves the** **CS****§****§****§ Ploppable version.  
      
    If you plan to use the** **CS****§****§****§ Ploppable version of this lot, I strongly recommend you download this building again and replace the original download.  
      
    Sorry for the mistake!**  
      
    **Introduction:**  
      
    Hip, urban living is yours at Ellsworth Lofts. Converted from an abandoned widget factory, Ellsworth Lofts has been retrofitted with all the conveniences and amenities your heart could desire, and all within walking distance of great shopping, dining and clubs (if you’ve designed your city that way, of course). Enjoy the street view from your ceiling-high factory windows, or catch some rays on the sun deck. Whatever you do, relax! Because at Ellsworth Lofts, you’re home!  
      
    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    The following versions are available:  
      
    • Ploppable landmark  
    • Growable medium wealth residential (R$$)  
    • Growable high wealth residential (R$$$)  
    • Growable high wealth commercial services (CS$$$)  
    • Ploppable high wealth commercial services (CS$$$)  
      
    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmarks menu.  
      
    **Version Information:**  
      
    There are five versions available, all on 2x3 lots. All growable versions will appear in the Chicago, New York, and Houston tilesets.
