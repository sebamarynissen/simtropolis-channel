  summary: Milwaukee Apartments
  description: |-
    The Milwaukee Apartments is a set of five small apartment buildings that are prevalent in some of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's poorer neighborhoods. Built primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, these apartments line many larger residential streets; the only real variation between them is in their brick and roof colors.

    For this set there are five unique color schemes and three lot types: the buildings are set to grow at random, for a possible 55 unique lots! All lots are Rยง growables only.

    ***\*\* A DarkNite version of the Milwaukee Apartments will also be released soon!***
