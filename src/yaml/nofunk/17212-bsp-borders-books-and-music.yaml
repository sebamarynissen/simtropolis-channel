    **Overview**

    *(Please be gentle... this is my first upload to the STEX!)*  
      
    In 1971, brothers Tom and Louis Borders opened the first Borders bookstore in downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan. From these humble beginnings, Borders has grown to become the world's second-largest retailer of books, music and video, with more than 1,200 stores and 35,000 employees in nine countries around the globe. **This BAT is a faithful recreation of the actual building**, except that some liberties have been taken with roof junk and lot design. However, it even features the ants mural on the back wall of the real-life building, which was also used as the icon for the landmark lot.  
      
    For SimCity4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which of the available versions you would like to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    **At a Glance**

    Complete lot statistics and values are available in the readme.

    **Installation**

    There are three versions (lot files) and one model file included. Simply unzip the contents of the download into your plugins folder, making sure to keep the model file and at least one of the lot files. (It is perfectly OK to keep all three!) For organizational purposes, you may wish to create a new folder to store these and all subsequent BSP releases. It is also advisable that you keep the readme and screenshots in a separate folder outside of your plugins for future reference. The readme and screenshots are not necessary for gameplay.  
      
    Please refer to the readme for more information.
