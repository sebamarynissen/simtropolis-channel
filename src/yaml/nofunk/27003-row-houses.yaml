  description: |-
    Add variety to your more urban neighborhoods with these perfectly generic, yet surprisingly unique 3-story row houses! They are wall-to-wall and blend in perfectly with other row houses sets!

    -   1x2 and 2x2 growable lots.  
        
    -   Available in both MaxisNite and DarkNite.  
        
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
