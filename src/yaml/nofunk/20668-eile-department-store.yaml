    **Introduction**

    Upscale urban shopping becomes a reality when you place the Eile Department Store in your city today! The Eile offers 10 floors of premier retail space for the savviest of shoppers.

    And if your city isn't quite ready for the most exclusive stores, there is a medium-wealth version available. ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)

    This model features TruNite.

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.

    The following versions are available:

    · Ploppable landmark

    · Ploppable functional high-wealth commercial offices

    · Growable high-wealth commercial offices

    · Ploppable functional medium-wealth commercial offices

    · Growable medium-wealth commercial offices

    **At a Glance**

    There are five versions available, all on 6x3 lots.
