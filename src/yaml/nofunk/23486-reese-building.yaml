  summary: Reese Building
  description: |-
    The Reese Building is simply a medium-wealth commercial services building that will fit well into any downtown. There are two lot types available, with both a ploppable and a growable of each: one is a 2x3 an the other a 3x3 with an expanded parking area.

    The building has a parking lot kiosk and cars parked behind it (and around it in the 3x3 version). My goal was to add some realism to the game, since many American downtowns have these sorts of public surface lots tucked in where buildings use to stand. Cars in these lots are often double-parked (parked two cars deep) and an attendant holds onto people's car keys so he or she can move the cars around the lot as necessary.

    Also in the back are two canopied entrances, so visitors do not have to walk around to the front of the building to enter.
