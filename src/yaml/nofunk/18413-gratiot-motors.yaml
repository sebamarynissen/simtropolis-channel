  summary: Gratiot Motors
  description: |-
    **Introduction:**  
      
    While not an official BSP upload, the Gratiot Motors was inspired by the many auto manufacturers and factories that thrived in Detroit, Michigan during the first half of the Twentieth Century.  
      
    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. It is up to you to decide which version(s) you want to use. It doesn't matter if you select only one or if you decide to use all of them simultaneously; there are no conflicts or other limitations that would prevent you from doing so.  
      
    The following versions are available:  
      
    •    Ploppable landmark  
    •    Ploppable manufacturing industry  
    •    Growable manufacturing industry  
      
    Note: All ploppable versions feature individual custom menu icons that will allow you to see immediately which version is which. All ploppable versions are grouped together near the center of your Landmark menu.  
      
      
    **Version Information:**  
      
    There are three versions available, all on 5x4 lots.

    **Installation:**  
      
    First of all, I recommend you unzip the entire contents of this .zip into some archive folder where you keep all building versions, readme, and screenshots, and maybe even back it up onto a CD or an external HD together with your other SC4 stuff. This way, if you need to clean your HD and reinstall your OS, you can simply copy the stuff from your backup archive into your plugins folder instead of having to rebuild your plugins from scratch.  
      
    That said, in order to use this building in game, I suggest you first go to your plugins folder and make a sub-folder for this download. Then, simply copy the Gratiot\_Motors.SC4Model file (the actual building model) plus the lot file(s) of whatever version(s) you'd like to use into the newly created sub-folder.  
      
    Of course, you can also choose the opposite approach, i.e. unzip everything into your plugins folder and simply delete or move out all versions you don't want to use.  
      
    Remember that the screenshots and this readme are not needed by the game, but it is a good idea to store them somewhere.  
      
    To uninstall a version you don't like, first bulldoze all instances of that version in your cities, then save the cities and exit. Now you can safely remove the version without running any risk to get crashes or facing any other inconvenience.  
      
    **Special Thanks**
