  summary: Extensive Grass Lots
  description: |-
    Have you ever designed your city with the means for a "green" and beautiful city, but after you've planned it, you have an annoying gap that you either need to fill with a large amount of 1x1 grass lots, or just leave it empty?

    Well, no more. This set is designed to improve your cities with an extensive range of sizes of grass lots. The sizes are as follows:

    1x1

    1x2

    1x3

    1x4

    1x5

    2x2

    2x3

    2x4

    3x3

    4x3

    4x4

    5x5

    Just install them into your plugin folder. The files inside the zip include the readme and the dat file. Any questions about it, just ask.
