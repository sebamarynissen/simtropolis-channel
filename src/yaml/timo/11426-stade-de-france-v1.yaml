    I couldn't wait any longer, so here it is! Now I can focus on something else...

    **The Stade de France :**
    This Stadium is located in Saint Denis near Paris. Construction started august 1995, and was achieved in november 1997.
    It hosted the France 98 Football World Cup final on July 12th 1998 and saw the historic victory of France 3-0 over Brazil.
    The stade de France is now the home of french national teams (football, rugby), and can host all kind of sport and cultural events(concerts, one man shows, car racing, wind surfing...).
    Architects : Macary-Zublena-Regembal-Costantini
    Capacity : 80000
    Inaugurated : january 1998

    The lot is 21x20 (it's huge but the real one is even greater) and has a strong landmark effect. See readme file for full details.

    Hope you like it!
