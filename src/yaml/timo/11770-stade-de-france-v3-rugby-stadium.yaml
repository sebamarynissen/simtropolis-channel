  summary: Stade de France Rugby Stadium
  description: |-
    I noticed there was no rugby stadium yet... So here is the first one! I hope this will satisfy some of you!

    It's the same stadium I released, in a rugby version. The BAT is improved, and the lot is better looking. It is the 3rd version of the stadium, you can find on the STEX an up to date [football version](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?mode=files&filetype=mine&user=80108&startrow=1&category=default&show=12) (due to file size there are 2 different downloads).
    See read me for full details.

    Please comment, rate, and enjoy!
