  description: |-
    A

    small office branch of Mcorp, perfect for your Commercial Office $$

    zones. The employees enjoy the rooftop terrace. This will grow in

    medium density on corner lots, it also grows fairly infrequently so it

    is good for maintaining the diversity of your cities as it will not

    'take over'. It has 100 CO$$ jobs and is 2x2.
