  description: |-
    These are a couple of small modern rowhomes that are R$$ with 30 residents. They are on 1x2 lots and grow. The files are Aluminum Rowhomes and Titanium Rowhomes. It is a remake of an older version by the same name, so if you have that version installed, just delete those files and replace with these, if you do this, any existing occations of the building in you cities will be replaced with this new one.
