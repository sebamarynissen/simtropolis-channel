  summary: The Carbon Building
  description: |-
    A midrise office building with two lots, a 1x2 and a 1x1. The building

    is CO$$$ and has 63 jobs. It should help to add to the diversity of

    midrise office buildings and thin out the monotonous masses of 'Reflect

    Systems' & 'Brink Real Estate' and the like. Blends in great with

    the maxis buildings. please vote!
