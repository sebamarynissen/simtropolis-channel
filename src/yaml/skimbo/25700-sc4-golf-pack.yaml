  summary: Skimbo's SC4 Golf Pack
  description: |-
    The "DragonGolfClub" in this pack is a fictional golf club originally made for my CJ Dragon Islands, I made it because I did not like the textures and variation of trees at the other golf sets on the STEX. I wanted to see a realistic number of tees, use more realistic textures for the fairways and see the most beautiful trees at their edges, so I choose the trees of Simfox. Of course I wanted to add some life as well, the maxis golfers alone are somehow boring so I decided to search for E-Carts and found the ones made by Simgoober that fit in niceley. Than I noticed that there is no driving range avaiable that fits in with the textures, so I lotted one as well, A range with grass tees, 4 roofed tees for rainy days, A pitch&put green, practice bunkers, enough space for long drives and, of course, life. Golfers are practicing, e-carts are parking next to them.

    I want to thank all the creators of the nice props for their wounderful work that made this set possible.
