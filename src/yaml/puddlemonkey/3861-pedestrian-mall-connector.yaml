    Ped Mall Tile Connector

    \-----------------------

    This lot is for use with the Network Addon Mod only. For information on the NAM, check out the massive discussion thread about it!

    Use this lot to connect Ped Mall Tiles to other network tiles. Ped Mall Tiles come with the Network Addon Mod and can normally only be accessed via a directly attached mass transit stop.

    Create your pedestrain mall as normal but place one or more Ped Mall Connectors between your mall and any roads / streets / avenues that you wish sims to be able to gain direct (walking) access from.

    This lot has been created to match the second style of ped mall tile which is accessed through the tab key. In fact, the texture used for the Ped Mall is slightly lighter than the one that comes with SimCity - a shame. Maybe this can be sorted.

    Check out the jpegs for an idea of how it works.

    To install, copy the SC4lot file to your My Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins folder.

    You are free to modify and redistribute this lot as you wish. If you improve it, let me have a copy please! :-)

    Enjoy.
