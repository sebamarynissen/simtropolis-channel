  summary: European Busstops
  description: |-
    This download contains 2 versions of a European Busstop (one for use in suburban- and one for urban areas) The models are based on busstops which are common to see in Germany and other European countries. The lots are modefied to show 6 different advertising spaces (o2,DHL,Mc Donalds, Burger King, SimCity 4 and a custom one). Each time you will place the busstop it will show another advertisment.

    This is my first upload so I'm sorry if I've made mistakes, but  at least it worked when I was testing it.

    So i hope you like it and have fun using it.

    Dependencies are:
