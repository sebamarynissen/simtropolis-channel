    History of the „Moederkerk“:

    the Reformed "Great Church" (Grosse Kirche), a large Gothic building completed in 1455, containing the tomb of Enno II. (d. 1540), count of East Friesland.

    From about 1550 the members of the Reformed Church, above all in the South of the Netherlands, founded their own underground church. They named themselves “Churches under the cross,” on the model of the Huguenots. The church in Emden

    layed an important role for the rootless pastors of this underground church. It was thus called “moederkerk” (mother church)
