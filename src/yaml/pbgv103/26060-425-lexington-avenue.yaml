    425 Lexington Avenue

    \-Helmut Jahn, 1988

    Jahn, the German-American, Chicago-based architect, designed this building to blend with and compliment its surroundings. This was required in a neighborhood with so many architecturally rich and recognizable buildings such as the Chrysler Building, just next door, and the UN Secretariat down the street. Jahn's other Manhattan works include Park Avenue Tower, 750 Lexington, and the CitySpire Center. All are great examples of the architect's bizarre style and 80s opulence.

    About this BAT:

    This download includes dark night and maxis night versions. Please pick one and delete the other after transfering the files to your plugins folder. There are four versions of the lot included in the zip file. They are a stage 7 growable lot (CO$$$), a stage 9 growable CAMeLOT (CO$$$), a plopable CO$$$, and a landmark.

    Also, the lot is 2x3, but there is a 2x1 overhang in the rear where the plaza is located.

    If you have the older version that was released last summer please delete it from your plugins folder before adding this version.

    SC4PIM stopped working for me so I was unable to modd the files. Luckily Cockatoo helped me out with all of that. So here's a big thank you to him! ![:golly:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGolly.gif)
