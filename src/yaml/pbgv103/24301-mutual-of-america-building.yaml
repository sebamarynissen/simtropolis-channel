  summary: Mutual of America Building
  description: |-
    Hey everyone!  Happy 4th of July for all you Americans out there!  I know this isn't my best BAT yet, but I'm releasing it prematurely because it has American flags, which I think is appropriate for today.  I hope you enjoy it, and keep an eye out for an update with fixes and jobs!

    Update:  Finally it's here!

    Before downloading this update please delete the older version from your plugins folder.

    This file includes an updated version of 320 PA that is NWM friendly and has 2185 CO$$$ jobs.  It is plopable from the landmarks menu and still sits on a 3x4 lot.

    All credit for modding goes to Gwail.
