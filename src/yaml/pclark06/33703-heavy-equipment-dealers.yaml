  summary: Heavy Equipment Dealers
  description: |-
    There was a lack of construction dealers for the game so I made some to diversify industrial areas. Each have a 6x6 I-M2 grow and a Landmark plop lot (in case you want to build without the industrial effects)  
      
    **Caterpillar -** Two Caterpillar dealers. Caterpillar Inc. (sometimes shortened to CAT) is an American Fortune 100 corporation which designs, develops, engineers, manufactures, markets and sells machinery, engines, financial products and insurance to customers via a worldwide dealer network. They have the highest market share in the construction industry and are particularly well known for their dealer network. Terry Sikes CAT and Quinlan CAT are fictional names I made up for them.  
      
    **Komatsu -** The second largest construction equipment company by market share, and also known for their dealer network. Komatsu is larger in places like Japan and China but I made sure to give them a dealer as well. Komatsu and CAT combine for 25% of the market share in construction equipment around the world.  
      
    **Assorted Dealer -** Most other construction equipment dealers are places that sell multiple brands, so this one does exactly that. I made this a one-stop shop for multiple brands like Manitowoc, Case, Hitachi, JCB, and Terex. I'll probably revisit and give some their own dealers in the future, most likely Case.

    IMPORTANT: for most of the construction equipment to show up, you need the R6 packs from ToutSimCities. It's somewhat esoteric, considering they were some of the first HD props, and I made these lots to highlight them because I'm a big fan of them.
