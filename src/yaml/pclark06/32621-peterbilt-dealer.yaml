  summary: Peterbilt Dealer
  description: |-
    Since 1953, Raymond Brothers Peterbilt has serviced SimNation's trucking needs by being the largest Peterbilt dealer that SimNation has to offer. They also now sell Kenworth trucks and the facilities offer a full body shop, repair, and sales of Cummins, CAT, Detroit Diesel truck engines as well as powertrains by Eaton. In addition, the first floor sales showroom also offers truck parts and supplies for the modern trucker on the road. The second floor consists of offices for staff. The dealer is based off of the Peterbilt dealership on American Truck Simulator, which, in turn, is based off of Jackson Group Peterbilt out of Salt Lake City, Utah.  
      
    This includes two lots, both 7x9: a Landmark lot and an IM lot to fill out your manufacturing demand.  
      
    Thanks to [@kingofsimcity](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/33566-kingofsimcity/) for the lotting, it turned out so so well! Coming soon for version 1.01: A smaller CS$$ version of the building without the extra garage. I couldn't resist uploading this lotting masterpiece for the community.
