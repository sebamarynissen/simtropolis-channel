  summary: SQRL Fuels Station
  description: |-
    "Not only is SQRL Fuels the name of the company, but it also stands for the values that we uphold: Service, Quality, Relationships, and Loyalty. These values are integrated into every aspect of our business, from providing top-quality fuel products to offering exceptional customer service."

    SQRL Fuels started in 2021 in the Little Rock, Arkansas area, and brands itself as a sort of "movement" rather than a typical gas station by targeting disaffected franchisees of larger gas station brands. In the south, you can see lots of former Sunoco and Exxon gas stations convert to the much more modern SQRL branding. They have quickly grown to over 350 locations which would put them among the top 25 largest gas station chains in the country, which is wild to think about because they didn't exist at all when I started BATing in 2016. They have locations as far south as Florida and as far north as Wisconsin, and the "movement" could come to your town too considering how quickly they have grown.  
      
    2x3 Growable C$$1. Two lots with and without the tall sign.
