  summary: Habitat for Humanity ReStore
  description: |-
    "Shopping at a Habitat ReStore isnâ€™t like the shopping experience anywhere else. Part home improvement store, part homegoods store, part resale store, each ReStore has a wide selection that changes often. You benefit because you get fantastic new and gently used home improvement items below retail prices. Folks in your community and around the world benefit because your purchase supports Habitat for Humanity." - Habitat For Humanity's website

    There are 900 Restore locations in the US. Think of them as a combination thrift store and hardware store as they offer similar offerings to an Ace Hardware or Home Depot, but a lot of the products are secondhand or donated. CS$$3x3 Stage 2 lot.
