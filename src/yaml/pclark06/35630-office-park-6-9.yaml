  summary: Office Park 6-9
  description: |-
    38 office buildings, with 9 in each "office plot," for suburban areas. Inspired by the endless amounts of office buildings that often have no deviation on one another in N. America. These are all stage 2 3x2 commercial offices with 8 or so different brands on each one. Can be used with [LotPlop](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/) for office parks or can be built individually/grown. Often these buildings are used for branch offices outside of main headquarters for various reasons. This also includes special buildings U and V which, if you are lucky, these special colored versions of these buildings will grow in your city (or you can just use the Lotplop).   
      
    After this will be plots 10-18, which are 1-floor variations but those aren't finished quite yet.

    A readme is included as to what brands are in each office building.
