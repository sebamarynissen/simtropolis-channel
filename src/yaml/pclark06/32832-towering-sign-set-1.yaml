  summary: Towering Sign Set 1
  description: |-
    A set of branded signs as commonly seen from the interstate, especially in many rural and suburban highway exits.  
      
    Personally I use the hotel brands with [@RebaLynnTS](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/68757-rebalynnts/)'s Modular Motel System, and pair them with [@kingofsimcity](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/33566-kingofsimcity/)'s modular parking that use [@shokthrpy](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/375506-shokthrpy/)'s parking pack textures, hence why the hotel brands have a pavement texture instead of a grass texture. I also have the lots and props in separate folders in case you don't want to use the lots, considering they do add a bunch of entries to the parks menu in-game.

    Dependencies:  
    [PC Mega Props Vol. 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/32952-pc-mega-props-vol-1/)  
    [SHK Parking Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27563-shk-parking-pack/)

    There are 74 signs included, including some brands that don't have existing buildings on here.
