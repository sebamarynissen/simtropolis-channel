  summary: Office Park 10-12
  description: |-
    Plots 10-12 of my office buildings that I made from 2022-23. I just never got around to releasing the rest of the buildings. These are one floor versions (others I have released are two floors). 

    27 office buildings, with 9 in each "office plot," for suburban areas. Inspired by the endless amounts of office buildings that often have no deviation on one another in N. America. These are all stage 2 3x2 commercial offices with 8 or so different brands on each one. Can be used with [LotPlop](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/) for office parks or can be built individually/grown. Often these buildings are used for branch offices outside of main headquarters for various reasons.  
      
    The readme is a list of the companies on these buildings.
