  summary: Retro Gas Stations 1
  description: |-
    **UPDATE 2 NOTES:** thanks to [@sejr99999](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/279388-sejr99999/)'s help these now grow.. But sacrifices were made and these lots are now medium wealth corner lots as opposed to low wealth. I have also added two new modern brands.  
    **Freedom** **(US)** \- Freedom Oil Co. in Illinois. Not related to the one in Australia  
    **Orion** \- chain of gas stations in the Miami, Florida area.  
      
    *Over 50 gas stations representing retro and current gas station brands for your cities. This is the first set of retro gas stations and I plan on doing a 1950s-60s themed one as well. I used a heavily modified model from CGTrader to make these (the top canopy and signs are all custom but the pumps and part of the attendant building comes from the model. These use the small attendant format that many gas stations used to use before brands started to utilize convenience stores and quick-serve food as their strategy. So many of these brands are in the midwest as quite a few brands popped up while people travelled westward on highways like US 40 and US 66 along with the advent of the interstate highway system. I used the gassigns.org database to compile what brands I wanted to make for this set.*
