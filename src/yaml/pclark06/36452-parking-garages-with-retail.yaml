  summary: Parking Garages With Retail
  description: |-
    Twelve fully functional mixed-use parking garages with first/second floor retail. Valet parking is reserved for the top floor but the retail is accessible from the parking spots and this setup has become quite common in American urban development in the 21st century. It feels like every other block has a setup like this now and now your virtual cities will have them too.  
      
    In real life these can occupy an entire city block, so these parking garages are 14x4 and are best built either with a road or a one-way on either side or with a road on one side and a pedmall on the other. They have a mixture of common brands and regional brands, and I find them best used in a college or hip younger urban district. There's also some unique types of businesses that haven't really been seen in the game, like a Botox clinic, a university t-shirt print shop or a swimming competition store. Real life parking companies like ABM make tons of money with these garages and now they are here to bilk your sims as well and tow their cars if they park for a minute too long. The occupancy is 7500-10000, which is unrealistic in real life but for the scale of the game, it'll do.
