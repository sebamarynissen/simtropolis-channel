  summary: Shake Shack
  description: |-
    Shake Shack is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a hot dog cart inside Madison Square Park in 2001, and its popularity steadily grew. In 2004, it moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries, chicken sandwiches, and its namesake milkshakes. The original location's popularity is such that that in the summer at its original location in NYC, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. The company advertises it uses natural Angus beef and claims that its meat has neither hormones nor antibiotics. Shake Shack operates 136 locations internationally as of October 2017, typically located in stand-alone restaurants and shopping malls. In 2018, they are often cited as one of the fastest-growing hamburger chains in the country.   
      
    This is a growable CS$$$ stage 2 lot, as your high-wealth sims eat hamburgers too.
