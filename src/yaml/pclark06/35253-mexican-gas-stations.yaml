  summary: Mexican Gas Stations
  description: |-
    In 2014, the Mexican government decided to go away from a monopoly model where one government-run brand (Pemex) runs the entire retail gasoline industry. As a result, many American (like Mobil, Arco, Chevron) and European (Total, BP, Shell, Repsol, CEPSA) companies have gotten into the market. As well, there are many domestic brands that have popped up as well. Some of these may even end up in the US one day. What is interesting to me is with some of these new brands how modern the design is compared to some of the legacy brands. There's some flair to them. Each are 3x2 CS1 low wealth with an OXXO store which is the predominant convenience store that most gas stations are paired with in Mexico.  
      
    Akron  
    \-mostly in Guadalajara, sponsors the large soccer stadium there  
    Cargogas  
    \-central Mexico, and has "dog stations" with dog food for stray dogs  
    Ener  
    \-in Guadalajara, has a striking blue and black livery  
    Ferchegas  
    \-eastern and southeastern Mexico, known for it's mascot  
    Fullgas  
    \-large Texaco distributor in Central America, their gas stations look like Texaco without the branding as they wait to get the Texaco trademark  
    G500  
    \-owned by Glencore, a Swiss company, and is now the third largest brand behind Pemex and Oxxogas with 500 locations  
    Hidrosina  
    \-200 locations nationwide, known for emphasis on technology  
    Karzogas  
    \-in the Matamoros area and some locations also do car repair  
    KPetrom  
    \-Central Mexico brand with 40 locations  
    LaGas  
    \-mostly in Cancun and other touristy areas in Eastern Mexico  
    Orsan  
    \-Mobil distributor in Mexico that also has it's own branded gas stations  
    OXXOGas  
    \-gas brand by the large convenience store chain that is nationwide  
    PetroBlue  
    \-another Guadalajara brand, there's a lot of unique brands there now  
    PetroFigues  
    \-Pemex distributor that recently got into their own gas stations that are purple and black  
    RedPetroil  
    \-mostly in western Mexico along the coastline  
    Rendichicas  
    \-female oriented gas station where 90% of the employees are women, mostly in NW Mexico in places like Tijuana  
    Servifacil  
    \-large eastern Mexico brand  
    Silver  
    \-An alternate brand that Akron distributors use  
    SmartGas  
    \-Another coastal Mexico brand  
    Windstar  
    \-Northern Mexico, has locations in Texas and New Mexico as well  
      
    There are many more brands as it is quite the wild west-type market, but these are the main and/or most striking ones design-wise to me.
