  summary: International Trucks Dealer
  description: |-
    International Trucks is an American truck brand that is a subsidiary of Navistar International. They make heavy duty trucks and buses and are the fourth-largest truck brand by market share in the US, behind Kenworth, Peterbilt, and Freightliner. The branding on this is "Duran-Doran International Trucks," an obvious reference to the band Duran Duran.  
      
    I've had this in my HD for about a year, unfinished, but I realized it fit pretty snugly into the Freightliner lot [@kingofsimcity](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/33566-kingofsimcity/) did, and made some changes, and it blended in quite well.   
      
    Includes a 11x7 LM and a 11x7 IM1 lot. I also realize, after the uploading, there might be a LOD issue with the shadows, so this building is kind of a beta at the moment. That's what I get for waiting a year before checking the model. (EDIT: I checked and it was just the time of day I placed the building. weird)
