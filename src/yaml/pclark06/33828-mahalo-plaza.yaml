  summary: Mahalo Plaza
  description: |-
    Mahalo Plaza is a fictional shopping center with brands that you would normally see in the west coast of the United States or Hawaii. The green trim is influenced by real-life shopping centers as the architecture is a lot more vibrant in the Rainbow State. The flora is also muted to fit in with any sort of region (but usually it would feature a lot of palm trees).   
      
    Anchors are Longs Drugs and Savers. Longs Drugs is an American pharmacy chain with approximately 70 drugstores throughout the state of Hawaii and formerly in the Continental US. CVS bought them out in 2008 when they had 500 stores in the west coast and has since converted to a Hawaii-only brand. Hawaii is known for their intense brand loyalty so their retailers aren't what you would normally see in the mainland US. There's also a First Hawaiian Bank with this pharmacy. The other anchor, Savers, has 300 thrift stores in the western US and Canada. They also own Value Village in the Pacific Northwest and Canada.

    Other brands include Kumon, an educational franchise that started in Japan, Zippy's, a diner that has 24 locations in Hawaii, and Wahoo's Fish Taco, a popular west coast fish taco chain that has it's origins in SoCal.
