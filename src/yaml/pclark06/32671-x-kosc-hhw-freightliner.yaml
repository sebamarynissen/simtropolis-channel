  summary: x KOSC HHW Freightliner
  description: |-
    Hale, Harrington, and Walsh Freightliner is a fictional truck dealer located within SimNation. They sell Freightliner, Western Star, and used trucks. In real life, Freightliner and Western Star, both companies owned by Mercedes-Benz, hold about 45-50% of the market share for semis in the US. I built this based on a dealer in Birmingham, AL. This has bays for truck service as well as a showroom that also sells Cummins, Eaton, and Detroit Engines products.  
      
    This lot, honestly, is nothing without [@kingofsimcity](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/33566-kingofsimcity/). The lot itself, according to him, is based off of a dealer in Fontana, CA. There are new (diagonal!) textures included that really make the building stand out as a beacon for your industrial areas. Truck dealers in America tend to head industrial areas as the bright facade in front of the smokestacks and silos, especially on the highways.  
      
    Included is a LM, CS$$ (389 jobs), and IM (516 jobs) building for any of the ways you play the game. That's the beauty of versatility, just like a Freightliner truck. No wonder so many truck drivers drive them.  
      
    Thanks again to [@kingofsimcity](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/33566-kingofsimcity/) for the lotting!
