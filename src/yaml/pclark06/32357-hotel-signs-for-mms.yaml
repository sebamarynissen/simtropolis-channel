  description: |-
    Some hotel signs for [@RebaLynnTS](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/68757-rebalynnts/)'s Modular Motel System that was released a long time ago on the PLEX.

    Brands included: Knights Inn, La Quinta, Motel 6. The lots with the signs on them will be found in the parks menu. Lot size 1x1.
