  description: |-
    Some hotel signs for [@RebaLynnTS](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/68757-rebalynnts/)'s Modular Motel System that was released a long time ago on the PLEX.

After a couple requests to release the hotel signs I posted in a gallery image of mine, here they are. To be used with this:

    Brands included: Knights Inn, La Quinta, Motel 6. The lots with the signs on them will be found in the parks menu. Lot size 1x1.
