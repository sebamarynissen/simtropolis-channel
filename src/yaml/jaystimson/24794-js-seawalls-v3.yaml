  summary: JS Seawalls V3
  description: |-
    This set functions like V2 (requires use of the "setsealevel" cheat) but is different (and better) due to the following features:

    1\. The use of prop family IDs for the **ortho\_1x and diag\_1x** lots to avoid the repeating texture problem when building long stretches.

    2\. Resized prop exemplars which allow mayor-mode flora to be placed on the ground (grass) section of the diag and ortho-to-diag pieces.

    3\. A new texture.

    All the details, list of lots, how to use, etc. ... are in the readme file. Please read.

    1\. Lots are located in your Landmark Menu near or at the bottom.

    2\. All lots have minimal Landmark and Park effect.

    3\. Plop Cost = $1, Monthly Budget Amount = $1. (A super deal from Walmart)

    There are no dependencies.

    For those who want to avoid using the "setsealevel" cheat so you don't have to rebuild your bridges and tunnels,

    I've posted an "how to" in the forums at:
