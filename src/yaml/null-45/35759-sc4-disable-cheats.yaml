    A DLL plugin that allows the player to choose which cheats are enabled in-game.

    **System Requirements:**

    * Windows 10 or later.

    **Installation:**

    1. Close SimCity 4.
    2. Copy SC4DisableCheats.dll and DisabledCheats.txt into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3. Configure the cheats you want to disable, see the Configuring the plugin section.

    **Configuring the plugin:**

    1. Open DisabledCheats.txt in a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
    2. Note that depending on the permissions of your SimCity 4 installation directory you may need to start the text editor with administrator permissions to be able to save the file.
    3. Add the cheat codes you wish to disable on individual lines.
    4. Save the file and start the game.

    **Troubleshooting:**

    The plugin should write a SC4DisableCheats.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
