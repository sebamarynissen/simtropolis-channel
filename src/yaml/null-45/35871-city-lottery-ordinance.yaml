    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a city lottery to the game.

    Availability Requirements: None.
    Income: Base income of §500/month, plus additional income based on the residential wealth group populations.
    Effects:

    **Positive:**

    * Cs§ Demand Effect: +1%.
    * School EQ Boost Effect: +2%. This mimics the fact that some jurisdictions use money gained from lotteries for education funding.

    **Negative:**

    * Crime Effect: +10%.

    **System Requirements**

    * Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1. Close SimCity 4.
    2. Copy SC4CityLotteryOrdinance.dll and SC4CityLotteryOrdinance.ini into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3. Copy CityLotteryOrdinanceText_English.dat into your SimCity 4 Plugins folder.
    4. Configure the plugin settings, see the Configuring the plugin section.

    **Configuring the plugin**

    1. Open SC4CityLotteryOrdinance.ini in a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
    2. Note that depending on the permissions of your SimCity 4 installation directory you may need to start the text editor with administrator permissions to be able to save the file.
    3  Adjust the settings in the [CityLotteryOrdinance] section to your preferences.
    4. Save the file and start the game.

    **Settings overview:**

    MonthlyConstantIncome is the base monthly income provided by the ordinance, defaults to §500.

    **Wealth Group Income Factors**

    The following values represent the factors (multipliers) that control how much each wealth group contributes to the city lottery's monthly income based on the group's population. A value of 0.0 excludes the specified wealth group from the city lottery. For example, if the city's R§ population is 1000 and the R$ income factor is 0.05 the R$ group would contribute an additional §50 to the monthly income total.

    R$IncomeFactor: income factor for the R§ population, defaults to 0.05.
    R$$IncomeFactor: income factor for the R§§ population, defaults to 0.03.
    R$$$IncomeFactor: income factor for the R§§§ population, defaults to 0.01.

    **Ordinance Effects**

    The following options control the effects that the ordinance has on crime, Cs§ demand and school EQ.

    CrimeEffectMultiplier: the effect that the ordinance has on global city crime. Defaults to 1.10, a +10% increase. The value uses a range of [0.01, 2.0] inclusive, a value of 1.0 has no effect. Values below 1.0 reduce crime, and values above 1.0 increase crime.

    Cs$DemandEffect: the effect that the ordinance has on Cs§ demand. Defaults to 1.01, a +1% increase. The value uses a range of [0.01, 2.0] inclusive, a value of 1.0 has no effect. Values below 1.0 reduce Cs§ demand, and values above 1.0 increase Cs§ demand.

    SchoolEQBoostEffect: the effect that the ordinance has on the global EQ level. Defaults to 102, a +2% boost in EQ. The value uses a range of [0, 200] inclusive, a value of 100 has no effect. Values below 100 reduce school EQ, and values above 100 increase school EQ.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4CityLotteryOrdinance.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
