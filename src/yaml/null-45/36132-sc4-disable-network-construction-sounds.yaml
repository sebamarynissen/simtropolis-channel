  description: |
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that disables the sounds that are played during the network construction animation.

    The plugin patches the game's memory to make it skip playing the jackhammer sound track that is normally used during the animation.

    Note that this will also disable 2 in-game messages that are sent at the start and end of the animation sequence. The messages are:
    kSC4MsgConstructionRoadCrewStart (0x89F10866) and kSC4MsgConstructionRoadCrewEnd (0xA9F10E45).

    **System Requirements**

    *     SimCity 4 version 641
    *     Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1.      Close SimCity 4.
    2.      Copy SC4DisableNetworkConstructionSounds.dll into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3.      Start SimCity 4.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4DisableNetworkConstructionSounds.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
