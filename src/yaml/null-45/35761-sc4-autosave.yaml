  description: |
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that automatically saves a city at user-specified intervals.

    This auto-save plugin does not require any launcher and will work with any digital Windows version of the game, Steam, GOG, etc. The disc-based versions should also work if fully patched.

    If you use a 3rd-party launcher that has its own auto-save setting you will need to disable that option when installing this plugin.

    **System Requirements**

    * Windows 10 or later.

    *The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test tha*t.

    **Installation**

    1. Close SimCity 4.
    2. Copy SC4AutoSave.dll and SC4AutoSave.ini into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3. Configure the auto-save settings, see the Configuring the plugin section.

    **Configuring the plugin**

    1. Open SC4AutoSave.ini in a text editor (e.g. Notepad). 
    *Note that depending on the permissions of your SimCity 4 installation directory you may need to start the text editor with administrator permissions to be able to save the file.* 
    2. Adjust the settings in the [AutoSave] section to your preferences.
    3. Save the file and start the game.

    **Settings overview:**

    IntervalInMinutes: is the number of minutes that elapse between auto-save attempts, defaults to 15 minutes. Note that the save timing may not be exactly this value depending on what the game is doing. For example, auto-save is disabled when the game is paused.

    FastSave controls: whether the game skips updating the region thumbnail when saving, defaults to true. With this option enabled the save operation is equivalent to the Ctrl + Alt + S keyboard shortcut, when disabled it is equivalent to the Ctrl + S keyboard shortcut.

    IgnoreTimePaused: controls whether the time the game spends paused is ignored when counting towards the next auto-save point, defaults to true.

    LogSaveEvents: controls whether the save events for the current session will be written to the log file, defaults to true.


    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4AutoSave.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.

    **Support and Source Code**

  warning: |-
    This DLL plugin comes with one INI configuration file:

    * `SC4AutoSave.ini`

    To complete the installation, copy these files from the package subfolder into the root directory of your Plugins folder and edit them to set your preferences.
