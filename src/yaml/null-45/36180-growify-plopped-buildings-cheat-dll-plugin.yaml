    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a cheat code to convert plopped buildings to a growable RCI zone type.

    This mod is an in-game equivalent to the SC4 command line tool's growify command for editing save games (and the website version).

    One of the differences between the two tools is the building exemplar property that is used to detect the RCI building type.
    The SC4 command line tool uses the Capacity Satisfied property from the savegame's lot subfile.
    This plugin uses the Purpose property from the building's exemplar.

    **System Requirements**

    *     SimCity 4 version 641
    *     Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1.     Close SimCity 4.
    2.     Copy SC4Growify.dll into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3.     Start SimCity 4.

    **Using The Plugin**

    The plugin adds a Growify cheat code with the following syntax:

    Growify <zone type> <zone density> [make historical]

    The <zone type> parameter is one of: Residential, Commercial, Agriculture or Industrial.
    The <zone density> parameter is one of: Low, Medium or High.
    The [make historical] parameter is optional, when not present it will default to true. This behavior is intended to prevent the game from replacing the plopped building as part of its normal zone redevelopment process. Setting the value to false will preserve the game's existing historical option for that lot.

    All commands are case-insensitive.

    **Example Commands**

    The following command converts all commercial plopped buildings to the Commercial Medium-density zone: Growify Commercial Medium To save typing, you could also use: Growify Com Med or Growify C M. This works with any zone or density value.

    Because the Agriculture zone only has 1 density, it can be used with just the zone name: Growify Agriculture.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4Growify.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
