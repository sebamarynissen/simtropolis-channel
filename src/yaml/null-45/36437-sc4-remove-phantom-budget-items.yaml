  description: |
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that removes phantom items from the budget department lists.
    This DLL only removes the phantom budget entries, it does not remove the buildings, lots, or other in-game effects such as the Landmark or Park effects.

    **System Requirements**

    * Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1. Close SimCity 4.
    2. Copy SC4RemovePhantomBudgetItems.dll into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3. Start SimCity 4.

    **Using the Plugin**

    The plugin adds a RemovePhantomBudgetItems cheat code with the following syntax:

    RemovePhantomBudgetItems <category> [all]

    The <category> parameter is one of: Fire, Police, Jail, Power, Education or Health.
    The [all] parameter is optional, it makes the plugin to clear the specified budget category instead of only entries associated with plugin(s) that no longer exist. The [all] parameter is intended to be used if phantom budget items remain in the budget menu after demolishing all existing buildings in the specified category.

    All commands are case-insensitive.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4RemovePhantomBudgetItems.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
