  description: |
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a census UI that can be shown in the region view.

    The region census panel shows the totals for each RCI group in the region. It also allows the player to export a CSV file with statistics for the individual cities. The CSV file is written to Documents/SimCity 4/Region_View/<Region Name> using UTF-8 encoding. The region census UI can be activated from the region view using one of the following methods:

    * Clicking the middle mouse button.
    * Using the RegionCensus cheat.

    **System Requirements**

    * SimCity 4 version 641
    * Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1. Close SimCity 4.
    2. Copy SC4RegionCensus.dll into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3. Copy RegionCensusUI.dat into your SimCity 4 Plugins folder.
    4. Start SimCity 4.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4RegionCensus.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
