  description: |
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that disables the smoke that is shown after plopping a lot.

    The method that the game uses to place a lot takes a Boolean parameter that controls whether the smoke effect is shown.
    When that method is called by the lot placement UI tool it hard-codes that parameter to true, the plugin patches the game's memory to change it to false.

    **System Requirements**

    *     SimCity 4 version 641
    *     Windows 10 or later

    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute installed, but I do not have the ability to test that.

    **Installation**

    1.     Close SimCity 4.
    2.     Copy SC4DisableLotPlopSmoke.dll into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.
    3.     Start SimCity 4.

    **Troubleshooting**

    The plugin should write a SC4DisableLotPlopSmoke.log file in the same folder as the plugin.
    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
