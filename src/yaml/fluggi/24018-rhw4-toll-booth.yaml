  summary: RHW4 Toll Booth
  description: |-
    Hey guys,  
      
    There is still no toll both for RHW4 on the STEX (I didn't find one ![:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaTounge.gif)), so I made one.  
    The Toll Booth Model is not mine, it is made by MrSnoopy, so this (and the RHW, of course) is the only dependency.  
      
    As you can see on the screenshot, the direction is shown by the plop arrow.  
      
    **Update 1:**  
    Some values adjusted.  
    Please re-download if you downloaded it before.

    **Update 2:**

    Sorry, but the NAM team changed the ID of the RHW\-4 lot texture, so this file was broken for a long time.

    Updated the lot texture.  
      
    **Dependencies:**  
    [MrSnoopy's Toll Booths](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=4003) - To avoid brown boxes.  
    [The Real Highway Mod](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=853)  
    If you don't see the Lot Textures, update your RHW.

    NAM 31.2 or higher required, previous versions might work (not tested).
