  summary: The Büdchen
  description: |-
    The "Büdchen" was a small kiosk in Wermelskirchen, Germany. Because of a modernization project in the inner city, it was broken off.

    Now you can see it in an open-air museum.

    With this plugin, you can see it in your city ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)

    As you can see on the screenshots, there is a roundabout version and a normal one.

    It is time-controlled, it is closed at night.

    Both versions are functional landmarks with two jobs (![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)).

    **Update:**

    -   Bug which lets the game crash fixed

    -   The normal version got a new Lot design (new Dependency!) ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
