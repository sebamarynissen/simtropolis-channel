  summary: Overhanging Parkings
  description: |-
    The long awaited parkings with overhang are finally arrived! Thanks to the RKT0 model technology, creating those handy structures is now within reach of unskilled batters like me ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)

    Those parkings will tremendously help you dealing with those nasty diagonals in your quest of grid busting.

    **UPDATE 1.01**

    The lots were initially supposed to generate a 5 $ monthly income, not a expense. This has been addressed. Also new textures have been added for further customization.

    **What's in the package?**
    - 4 lots with 2 distinct shapes and their mirrored counterparts
    - 6 different textures design, to blend seamlessly with your favorite sidewalk mod (choose one, delete the other)
    - 4 offset car models in HD, an original creation from Girafe.
