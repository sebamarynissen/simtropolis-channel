  summary: SAM 1 Override
  description: |-
    Here is the SAM1 override - a little mod that will reskin your SAM 1 textures and display new props for your greater pleasure! A small variation willl occur on some textures and props (as can be seen on screenshots), depending of zoning.

    Not much else to say, but keep in mind that SAM 1, despite how it looks, does ***not*** have parking functionality: it's only purpose is eye-candy.

    **UPDATE 1.1**

    A fellow member brought to my attention a problem with the plugin - possibly due to the use of HD props and its incompatibility with software mode. For those who use software rendering and/or prefer to use SD props, a new iteration of the SAM 1 override has been created. The mod is now divided in 2 distinct folders: one for HD, one for SD. Please only use one at a time.

    **What's in the packs?**

    **HD Props pack**

    *SAM - 1 - Parking Lots Textures.dat:* contains the new textures specific to the HD setup

    *SAM - 1 - Type21.dat:* T21 files for HD car props

    *Bollard.dat\*:* small post model

    *Grfe\_Cars\_family\_props.dat\*:* turns those bootiful car props into bootiful family timed props

    *Lot Textures.dat*: lot textures for overriding SAM1 - style parkings

    **SD Props pack**

    *SAM - 1 - Parking Lots Textures.dat:* contains the new textures specific to the SD setup.

    *SAM - 1 - Type21.dat:* T21 files for SD car props

    *Bollard.dat\*:* small post model

    *Lot Textures.dat*: lot textures for overriding SAM1 - style parkings

    \* files already used in the [overhanging parkings](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29313-overhanging-parkings/): if you have the overhanging parkings in your plugins, you can delete them.

    **Installation**

    Must load after the NAM. You can also replace the texture and T21 dats directly in the SAM folder if so you desire.

    **Dependencies** (all optional beside the NAM - not having these will not trigger BB's)

    [NAM with the Street-Addon-Mod installed](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=746)

    [BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=746)

    [BSC - VIP girafe carpack vol. 1 & 2](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2821) (HD version only)

    [Neko Prop Set vol 03](http://hide-inoki.com/bbs/archives/files/1391.zip) (only **N****eko\_Fence\_Black\_2m.SC4Model** and **Neko\_Fence\_Black\_2m.SC4Desc** are needed)  
    (See [here](http://hide-inoki.com/bbs/archives/sc4_0837.html) for the main page)

    **Strongly suggested for users of the SD version**

    The T21 file that generates props use Maxis family cars as default; it's very likely you'll want somethng better to replace them.

    Choose **one** of the following replacement mods (they all supersede Maxis family cars), depending of your preferences:

    [1960s car replacement Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22109-1960s-maxis-automata-replacement-modd/)

    [Japan car replacement Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31944-japanese-car-replacement-mod/)

    **Credits**

    \- Special thanks goes to Mr. Jim, the author of this excellent and highly recommended [parking set](http://hide-inoki.com/bbs/archives/sc4_0860.html). The textures used by the SAM1 override are based on his textures and inspired me to create this mod.  ありがとう JIM!
