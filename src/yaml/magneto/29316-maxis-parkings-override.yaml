  summary: Maxis Parkings Override
  description: |-
    Have you grown tired of those Maxis textures on your lots? Here's another little mod - a texture replacement actually - that will replace every occurrence of these too much seen parking textures with newer textures.

    The mod is separated in 2 parts, one for the $ wealth level and the other for $$-$$$.

    Also, as can be seen in the mosaic, dimensional changes were kept to a minimum to avoid misplaced props issues, so things should run smooth on that side too.

    **Installation**

    To use this, simply toss the folder in your plugins. I'm unaware of other texture mods of this kind so anywhere in your folder should be fine, but note that a few textures are from the BSC texture packs, so if you use them ensure the mod loads after.

    **More!**

    Now that the textures are updated, how about updating the Maxis cars that sits on them? I strongly recommend you to get the [Car Automata Pack 1.0](http://hide-inoki.com/bbs/archives/sc4_0860.html) or any of mikeseith's car replacements available here on the STEX. Goodbye outdated Maxis parkings ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)

    **No dependencies**

    **Credits**
