#   description: |-
#     Introduction

#     This mod is totally based on Neko Panchi's sidewalk mod – it is aimed at players who enjoy using the mod but use RHD in their game.

#     Those who already use the mod will notice some minor changes – a few props were added (mostly road signs) while others were replaced (traffic lights & lamps).

#     Also the mod received a little extension – SAM10 streets (for Residential & Commercial zones only) and SAM7 (Industrial zones only) were added.

#     Folder description

#     **zCoreFile** folder contains the main T21 files

#     **Dependencies** folder containis models and family props

#     **zReplacement** folder contains a file that will replace default maxis lamps and traffic lights by Mandelsoft & Neko Punch models

#     Installation

#     Please refer to the enclosed readme.pdf
