    New version Ships pack.

    The battle ship Southern Dakota is added.

    Problems with a battle ship Iowa are corrected

    Now the ships swim on water area of your city. Any enemy won't dare now to attack your cities!![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)

    P.S.

    The one who asked to make tanks SU-85, SU-100 and ISU-152, I will make during close time. Simply I study and at me now practice.
