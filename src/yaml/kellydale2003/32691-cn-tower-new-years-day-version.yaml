  summary: CN Tower - New Year's Day version
  description: |-
    Happy New Year everyone!

    Here is the CN Tower from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This is the single tower. I will provide the full complex sometime in 2019. I've also noticed that I've made a couple of small errors and will update them accordingly. Follow this file and you'll receive a patch/update in the near future.

    For now, here's the single tower version (the complex will come later). Festive to New Year's Day, this lot is CS$$ and has fireworks!

    Now, you can add this overly massive telecommunications tower, turned tourist destination, to your city with festive style. This 553 meter (1,813+ feet) tower is the tallest building in Canada and was built to rival Toronto''s fast growing skyline.

    The Toronto skyline began blocking telecommunications services and thus the CN Tower was required. When the tower was under construction, it looked like something out of a sci-fi movie!

    Enjoy!
