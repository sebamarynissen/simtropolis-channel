    **Bay Adelaide Street West!**

    **HISTORY**

    Bay Adelaide Centre West is a real life 51-story tower in Toronto, Ontario. Located at 333 Bay Street, the 218M skyscraper was completed in 2009 and is located in the heart of Canada's largest financial district. With preserving heritage an important part of Toronto, the developers of Bay Adelaide Centre preserved the historical corner building by building over it whilst maintaining the facade of the building - with some restoration help, of course.

    This is also a very unique building due to its revolutionary night lighting. Using photometric realistic lighting combined with strategically placed bump maps, the illusion of realism is created. The total project rendering time for day and night is 332 hours (almost like the real life address - 333 Bay Street). This is the largest building ever exported using this revolutionary and high-memory-intensive technique.

    ONLY DARKNIGHT IS INCLUDED!
    Unfortunately, due to high rendering times, the dark night version can only be exported. If you do not have Simfox's DarkNight Mod, download it (link is in the read me of this file).
