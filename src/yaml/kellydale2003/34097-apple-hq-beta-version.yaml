    BETA: Uploading this rough draft I made just in case I never get to finish the building.

    **Apple’s headquarters, known as ‘Apple Park’ is a real life building in Cupertino, CA housing Apple's headquarters just south of San Francisco! Apple Park may be formerly known as Apple Campus 2 as well.**

    It's a 1x1 lot with 6,300 high-tech jobs. You must plop twice opposite from each other (you'll figure it out) to get the full circle effect resulting in 12,600+ jobs which is around how many people work at this building in real life! Add those subways, buses and pedestrian pathways!

    Realistically, you’re looking at a 32x32 lot to comfortably house the full structure on its own lot. It’s that massive!

    Your wealthy sim residents will be delighted to know a company worth $2 TRILLION will be moving in! Jobs, jobs, jobs!

    The LODs are snug so you can build anything you want in the middle!

    **No night lights** since this is just a draft building so far. The other small complimentary buildings and the final render of this project will be coming.

    **No dependencies** but NAM is recommended to use the pedestrian tiles and Girafe's beautiful trees are also a great recommendation!

    **ALSO, THE PURPOSE OF POSTING THIS BETA IS TO FIND IF SOMEONE CAN COME UP WITH AN AMAZING LOT! FEEL FREE TO RE-UPLOAD YOUR OWN VERSIONS OF THE LOT! My eyes will be on the lookout.**
