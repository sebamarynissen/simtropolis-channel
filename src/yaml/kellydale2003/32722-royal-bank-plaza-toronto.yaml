  summary: Royal Bank Plaza Toronto
  description: |-
    Hey everyone:

    Here is the Royal Bank Plaza -- a real life building in Toronto, Canada -- for your enjoyment. I have included two lots for the same model: One overhang (5x8) and one full lot (7x8). Both serve different purposes depending how packed your downtown core is.

    This is a CO$$$ as it houses boring bankers who sit behind glass tinted with real gold (like actually).

    The South Tower has 41 floors and the North Tower has 26 floors. They are joined together with an impressively high atrium with an adjoining outdoor plaza as an outdoor food court.

    **Dark nite only. No dependencies!**
