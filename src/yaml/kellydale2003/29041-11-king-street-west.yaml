    **HISTORY**

    11 King Street West is a real life building located in the Financial District of Downtown Toronto, Canada. The building is over 66m tall with 18 stories and was completed in 1965! Yes that's right, 1965! The building (obviously ahead of it's time) is located in the beautiful neighbourhood of "Old Toronto". The building is mainly occupied by Telus, but other leasers occupy other floors.

    **NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR**
    This project in particular was very challenging for the night lighting! Figuring out a new method of creating realistic lights I had trouble reducing rendering time to export this little guy. Fortunately all I needed to do was reduce the number of lights in the building in order to make a successful export. I (hopefully) appropriately named this new method of lighting Photometric Light Displacement Mapping  (PLDM).

    PLDM uses traditional aspects of 3dsmax... photometric lights & displacement maps. Combining the two is very heavy on rendering memory for computers. So reducing rendering time was a challenge. The advantage to PLDM is the realistic differed lighting from floor to floor, "inside-floor" perspective, realistic colors of lights, and an overall better shadow/light effect as opposed to traditional SimCity 4 lighting.

    PLDM reduces the illusion of "fake" lighting. Traditional SimCity 4 lighting calls for self-illuminated planes or boxes with textures. PLDM gives the illusion you're looking into a real floor of a building and seeing furniture (displacement maps) with realistic lighting (photometric lights). Unfortunately PLDM's major disadvantages are high rendering times, and HD zoom breaks the illusion (most of the time). So far (in my opinion), it has been the best lighting method introduced to SimCity 4 for various reasons (modelling speed being the best reason).

    Hope you enjoy PLDM's first debut! ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)
