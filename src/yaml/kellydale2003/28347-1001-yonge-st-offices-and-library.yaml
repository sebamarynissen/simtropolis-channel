    1001 Library & Offices is a 100% fictional midrise building perfect for your cities!

    The modern glass facade architecture was based off the podiums and base structure of Maple Leaf Square in downtown Toronto! Maple Leaf Square is located in the upcoming new neighborhood of the South Core and is viewable from the famous Gardiner Expressway!

    After constantly visiting Toronto for quite sometime I've finally decided to do a facade similar to one of my favorite structures!

    **Both downloads include a Library, AND a seperate office lot... both 6x4 lots! Anyways, Here's some more information!**

    **Did I mention there's no dependencies?**
