  summary: Four Seasons Hotel & Residences Toronto
  description: |-
    Hey everyone:

    Here is the beautiful Four Seasons Hotel & Residences located near downtown Toronto, Canada. The tallest tower is 55 stories tall and the 2nd is 30 stories. The penthouse cost $28 million CAD ($20M USD) and is Canada's most expensive penthouse as of January 2019.

    There are two ways to get this building into your city:

    1) Ploppable CS$$$ (high-service hotel); or

    2) Growable R$$$ (Stage 8) under the Houston tileset.

    Both are 6 tiles wide, 5 tiles deep.

    **Dark nite only. No dependencies!**
