    **HISTORY**

    **In this technological era of mankind it's nearly impossible to ignore all the amazing buildings being built in the Western World for modern medicine! This building helps keep up to speed with the biological research that is essential to the health of the modern World we live in today.**

    **An amazing trend in today's modern buildings is building green! This building is inspired to capture the green essence by reducing the number of windows and using recycled material to build. With the number of windows reduced, less light and heat enters the building resulting in less effort for air-conditioning.**

    **During the design of the building I had realized that another trend in building construction is that structures are being built smaller than their lots permit them! This has a profound effect on the environment. The more of a building that is accessible to the sunlight increases the surface area that can generate heat... essentially heating up a city! This building is designed to fit in wall-to-wall with other structures to reduce the surface area while maintaining modern architecture with a beautiful terrace!**

    **The building isn't designed to be an entire focal point for a city! It's merely meant to blend in with other medium rise buildings... We have too many skyscrapers, and too many whom want to take the cake!**

    The building is built for modern medicine and features both a COSSS or a High-tech version! When I initially asked the public in the Simtropolis chatroom if they would like a hospital version of this... they weren't too thrilled! So please, if you want a Hospital version of this... I'd be pleased to do so! Just post in my "Skyscrapers Galore ![^_^](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_5.gif)" forum!
