  summary: Royal Bank of Sims
  description: |-
    Lost my hard drive on a flight from LA to Canada. Everything is lost except this ugly model I never released.

    So, I thought I'd share this survivor rather than it being lost forever.

    4x4 with no dependencies. Dark nite only.

    Sorry I don't have the 3dsmax file to edit this or change it. It is what it is.
