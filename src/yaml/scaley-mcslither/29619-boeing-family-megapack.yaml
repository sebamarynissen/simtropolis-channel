#   description: |-
#     Thanks for downloading the Boeing Family Megapack. There are quite a few planes included here and an awful lot of dependencies required, so thanks for your patience in looking for them all – your experience with this add-on will be much better for it.

#     Firstly, a great big thank you to the original authors who graciously gave their permission for me to use their model files; in this case, Camil Valiquette, Eric Cantu and Albert Bouwman.

#     Thanks also to Josh6 and Fox who playtested these and other lots to help ensure that you receive high quality content. Apologies for the lack of nightlighting as it’s a skill that continues to elude me. (Perhaps someone out there with the talent and time would be willing to team up at some point to get this done or teach me how?)

#     Place the extracted file in your plugins folder. There is also a nested .zip file called “Generic Plane Dependencies” which is contains a number of required files; a custom query and several new props. The reason it’s nested is that it’s included with each of the 4 Megapack files (American Airlines, Boeing, A320 and A330) but only one instance is needed. **IT’S UP TO YOU TO ENSURE YOU HAVE EXTRACTED THE FILE IF YOU WANT THIS DOWNLOAD TO WORK PROPERLY!**

#     Included in the download are a selection of Boeing 737, 757, 767 and 777 passenger jets in a variety of liveries. All are lotted with dark ramp textures and will appear in the Airport menu.

#     ***Boeing 737***

#     ·         Aloha Airlines Boeing 737-800 (Defunct Airline)

#     ·         Southwest 737-700 (Blue Livery)

#     ·         Southwest 737-700 (Shamu Livery – FA model included)

#     ***Boeing 757***

#     ·         Allegiant Boeing 757-200

#     ***Boeing 767***

#     ·         Air Canada Rouge 767-300ER

#     ***Boeing 777***

#     ·         Austrian 777-200ER

#     ·         Egyptair 777-300ER

#     ·         KLM 777-300ER (Diagonal and Ortho Model ONLY included; no lot)

#     **THE DEPENDENCIES**  
      
#     They are many. If you stayed up to date with AC Team and SCAG releases, the battle is mostly won already. BriPizza also has a few and I have a couple of surprises as well, even though they’re quite minor and basic.

#     Generic Plane Dependencies is an included collection of files that contains a custom query .dat and a collection of new pushback tugs and a fuel bowser. Thanks goes once again to Camil Valiquette for the ground handling equipment several of these are based upon.

#     The lots will appear near the top of the airports menu and sorted from smallest to largest. Each lot has a cost based on real-world value so a Boeing 737-700 that costs USD $70.9 million will cost $7090 in game. Most of the planes generate a small monthly income except for any parked on an apron. Since they are essentially not in service, these will incur a moderate monthly cost.
