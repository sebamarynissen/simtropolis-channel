  summary: Water Taxi Station wBus Stop  New Water Taxi
  description: |-
    This is a 10000 capacity modern water taxi station, functions like the original passenger ferry terminal, plus more.

    The 1x4 station comes with its own bus stop, saves us from wasting a tile to a bus stop.

    A compact yellow & black water taxi will transfer your sims from station to station, as well as the original ferry terminals. Good news: this GDV water taxi is a totally new passenger ferry boat so it won't replace the original passenger ferry. The game will randomly show the original passenger ferry or the new water taxi embarking from this water taxi station, as well as the original ferry terminal!

    Reasonable priced $0.10 per ferry ticket will add some simoleons to your city fund.

    Find it under Water Transit menu

    Rush Hour Expansion: required
