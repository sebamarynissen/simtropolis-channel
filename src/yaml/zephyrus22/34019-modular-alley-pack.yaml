  summary: Modular Alley Pack
  description: |-
    Garbage is an inconvenient issue that every city must deal with, and SimCity is no exception. But instead of leaving your dirty garbage on the front curb, why not have a dedicated space for your sims to dispose of their waste, hidden away from public view?

    This is a series of six 1x1 alley pieces designed to be mixed-and-matched to go between buildings mid-block. It was inspired by the alleyways of Chicago and works best in an urban environment. The alleys technically function as a park (and can be found in the Parks menu), but I've tried to minimize their impact so that they do not artificially inflate the values of surrounding buildings. As such, these are eyecandy lots and are not transit-enabled.

    This is my first ever lot, so please let me know if you encounter any issues with these files or have feedback to improve these lots. I've tried to ensure that these lots have **No Dependencies**, but let me know if you see any problems.

    **To Install:** Simply download the folder and unzip into your Plugins folder.
