  summary: Ancient Greek Temple
  description: |-
    In addition to my very first BAT ever, an Ancient Greek Theatre ([http://community.sim...-greek-theatre/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27838-ancient-greek-theatre/)) I present: an Ancient Greek Temple! I learned how to texture in 3ds max, so the temple is looking way better than the theatre, but I'll probably change the textures of my theatre in the future.

    Stats:

    Plop cost: ยง0 (as the Ancient Greek built it)

    Monthly cost: ยง50

    Bulldoze cost: 25,000ยง (as it is on the UNESCO list and isn't supposed to be demolished at all)

    Landmark effect: 100, radius: 50

    Park effect: 100, radius: 50

    No dependencies.

    Enjoy!
