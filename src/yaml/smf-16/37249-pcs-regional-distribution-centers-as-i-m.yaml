  summary: PC's Regional Distribution Centers as I-M
  description: |-
    I really like the concept of [@pclark06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/364367-pclark06/)'s [Regional](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36215-pc-regional-distribution-centers-a-j/) [Distribution](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36216-pc-regional-distribution-centers-k-z/) [Centers](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36225-pc-regional-distribution-centers-retail-1/), but unfortunately they come as landmarks without jobs. This is a bit annoying, because they take up a lot of space in your industrial districts and hence you lose valuable land with no jobs.

    To solve this, I created this mod which gives all of the regional distribution centers 320 I-M jobs. I did not modify the original lots, but instead created an entirely new set, so if you have already used the original landmark versions in your city, they will remain unaltered.

    ## Dependencies

    Obviously this mod needs the original distribution centers as dependency:

    -   [pclark06:regional-distribution-centers-a-j](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36215-pc-regional-distribution-centers-a-j/)
    -   [pclark06:regional-distribution-centers-k-z](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36216-pc-regional-distribution-centers-k-z/)
    -   [pclark06:regional-distribution-centers-retail-1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36225-pc-regional-distribution-centers-retail-1/)

    **You also need all dependencies of the original files**, so do yourself a favor and install this mod with [sc4pac](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36700-sc4pac-mod-manager/), which handles all of the dependencies for you.

    If you don't plan to use the landmark versions **and you haven't already used them in your cities**, you can get rid of the `/Lots` folders in the original distribution centers, but **YOU MUST** keep the `/Buildings` and `/Props` folders, otherwise you *will* get brown boxes.

    ## Submenu support

    The new lots will, just like the original ones, appear in the landmarks menu, but again, do yourself a favor and use this with memo's [Submenus DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/), after which both the I-M lots and the original ones will appear in the I-M submenu.

    ## Acknowledgements

    Many thanks go to [@pclark06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/364367-pclark06/) for making the fantastic original lots.
