    **Airport Security Fence Roads and Taxiway Fillers**

    **Just doing an update...**I will wait 10 min for the possibility someone is downloading now then I'll do an update so don't download until this message has been removed.

    NOTE: This is my first upload, and these were made some time ago to specifically fit into my games airport which was widely based on Scaley McSlithers (DRP) Diagonal Runway Project.  
    The base textures are quite specific but there are other airport downloads that use the same textures ..I hope yours does too:)

    **Lot Details:**

    -   Grass fillers to match the tarmac grass edges to remove the zigzag effect that the diagonals cause.
    -   Ortho and diagonal security fences made with memos *Bat4Blender*, with a variety of roads to suit the tarmac and airfield grasses.
    -   The majority of lots are 1x1, with all perimeter fence lots having a park effect on air pollution.
    -   SPOT props have been added to help with road directional placement.
    -   All lots will be found in the Airports Menu.
    -   A Submenus patch folder will be in the download folder. If using the Submenus Dll, all lots will be found in the Airport submenu "SF Fillers". (it can remain there unless you want to move/delete it, it will have no effect unless you use the Submenus Dll and its required dependencies).

    Thanks to philforhockey51, rsc204, Tyberius06, nos.17, memo, ACEfanatic02, CorinaMarie and hugues aroux in all my SC4 journeys to date.
