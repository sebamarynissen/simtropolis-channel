  summary: Aspen Village Condominiums  Multi Color Version
  description: |-
    After hearing many requests for this from all over the Simtropolis community, I have decided to release a new multi colored version of the Aspen Village Condos. There are three new colors included in this download: Yellow, Avocado, and Blue. There is only one lot file, and it has built on it its own unique building family, meaning that whenever the lot grows in the game, one of the four colored condos will be randomly selected to appear. This will add a great more deal of variety to the lot than my previous version. (I'll keep the old version up for those that would prefer just the one color) Whether you run this file or the older one, you should only have one of them installed at a time so they don't interfere with each other. Special thanks goes to BarbyW for putting together the building family for me!

    Disclaimer: This is a growable lot for the SPECIFIC reason that rsidential ploppables can't have commuters. That's just unacceptable to me. Also, the picture shows many complexes together in a "park" layout. This was done by zoning several 3x3 plots next to each other, and filled in with a ploppable parking lot I downloaded here from the STEX (although I must admit it was dificult to get all four colors to randomly grow together like that.)

    Specs:

    Type: R$$ Growable

    Stage: Level 4 (will develop on medium and high density plots only)

    Residents: 96

    Lot Size: 3x3

    Rendering Time: 40 minutes (each condo) on a 2.8gHz 1024 RAM machine
