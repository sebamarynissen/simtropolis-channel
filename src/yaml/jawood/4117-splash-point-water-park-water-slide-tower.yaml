  summary: Splash Point Water Park  Water Slide Tower
  description: |-
    I'm happy to announce the release of my first BAT in my ongoing water park project: Splash Point Water Park - Water Slide Tower. Modeled after Provo, UT Seven Peaks Resort. THis water slide tower contains 8 seperate water slides - four body flumes and 4 tude runs, 9 cabanas, a tube rental facility, and various picnic tables.

    This is the first lot of many to follow. Since the project has been taking me so long to do, I decided to release all of the lots seperatly as opposed to a pack release. At the rate this project's been going, it might be Christmas by the time that pack would be finished ;-)

    Please enjoy this BAT. It comes pre-made on it's own lot and ready to go into SimCity. It's found under the parks menu, costs $500 to plop, and $50 a month to maintain. All other stats follow park defaults, except water consumption has been upped quite a bit.

    Place in your My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins folder to install.
