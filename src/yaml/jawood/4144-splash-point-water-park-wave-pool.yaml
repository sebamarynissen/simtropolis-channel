  summary: Splash Point Water Park Wave Pool
  description: |-
    I'm again happy to announce the next release of the second BAT in my ongoing water park project: Splash Point Water Park - Wave Pool. Modeled after Provo, UT Seven Peaks Resort. Contains some basic night lighting in the pool.

    Be aware, this wave pool is meant to go hand in hand with the rest of the pack (so far that only includes the water slides.) but I'll release it by itself for those who want just the pool, or just the slides.

    Please enjoy this BAT. Just unpack the xip folder and place the dat file in your My Documents/SimCity 4/plugins folder. It will be found under the parks menu, costs $375 to plop, and $40 a month to maintain. All other stats follow park defaults, except water consumption has been upped quite a bit. Occupies a 4x4 space.
