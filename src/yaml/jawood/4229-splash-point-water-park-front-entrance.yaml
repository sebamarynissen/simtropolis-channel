  summary: Splash Point Water Park Front Entrance
  description: |-
    The third installation in my water park series. Not only is this BAT made to look good with the others in the pack, but it's also got some great features. It is a fully employed park lot! You will find it under the park menu along with its other fellow BATs, but at the same time it's a fully funtioning CS$$ lot. Sims will commute to it given there is demand for CS$$ in your town. (Note: the other lots are primarilly for looks. They have no workers, but have the possitive affects of a park.)

    Size: 4x4

    Employees: 262

    Type: Park/CS$$

    Plop Cost: $375

    Monthly Fee: $40

    Night Lighting: Yes

    Download and unzip the folder. Copy and paste the .dat file to your My Documents/SimCity 4/Pluggins folder. It will be under the park menu.
