  summary: vda Amsterdam Weesperplein 24 Diamond Exchange
  description: |-
    Amsterdam, Weesperplein 2-4, DiamondExchangeBuilding (1910/11). Designed by G.A. van Arkel (1858-1918), who also designed three of the bigger diamond workshops in the city of Amsterdam. Sober Art Nouveau, slightly based on Berlage's ExchangeBuilding at the Damrak (1898/03). The building not only housed the Diamond Exchange, but also a bank, a restaurant and a barber shop. Renovated in the early 1920s, 1959 (after a fire which destroyed the roof) and 1991, when a new roof was added. The BAT version shows the original design of 1910/11.

    (both 3x4 CO $$$ and 3x4 LM)

    ps. street textures taken from deadwoods' BSC JENX Amsterdam Central Station (not included in the zip)
