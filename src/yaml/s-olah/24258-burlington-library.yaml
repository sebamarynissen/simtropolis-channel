  summary: Burlington Library
  description: |-
    Just a small library for two...Made it yesterday, it turned out almost perfect (at least from my point of view). Has a plop cost of 2700 a bulldoze cost of 1600 and a monthly maintenance cost of 60 simoleons. Has a radius of 2600 meters, which is a lot, almost 3 times more than the small Maxis Library, which makes it perfect for small towns.

    There are **No dependencies** and **No Readme!**

    Installation: Just unzip the file in your Plugins folder.

    Enjoy!
