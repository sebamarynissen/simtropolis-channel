  summary: Simville Clinic
  description: |-
    I really got in the mood to make small stuff for small towns. So, next to the police station and jail, I also made a clinic, big enough to bed 680 people monthly for only 260 simoleons. It costs 630 to plop, and has a bulldoze cost of 420. it consumes 31 power and 13 water.

    There are **no Dependencies** and **no Readme**!

    Enjoy!
