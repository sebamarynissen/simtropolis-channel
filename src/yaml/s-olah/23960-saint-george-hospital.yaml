  summary: Saint George Hospital
  description: |-
    I started bating again, and while making some euro props for myself, I discovered a school which looked more like a clinic, so i made a few changes, renamed it, and decided to release it.

    **Saint George Hospital:**

    Monthly cost: 300

    Bulldoze cost: 250

    It has a radius of 1200 (which is 400 tiles more than the Large Medical clinic from Maxis) and a capacity of 2500 sims,  so it's perfect for spread out towns with small houses.

    It costs 1600 simoleons to plop, consumes 16 power and 6 water.

    There is NO Readme, and there are **NO dependencies!**

    Enjoy!
