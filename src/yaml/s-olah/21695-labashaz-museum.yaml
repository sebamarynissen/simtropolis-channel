    **"Labashaz" Museum**

    I just checked and noticed that my last upload here was almost over a year ago, so I figured I'll upload some of my new creations. This Bat is modelled after the "Labashaz" museum in Saint George, Romania. In the XVIIIth century it was used as a prison, "home" to many szeklers who were fighting for freedom.

    In SimCity, this Bat functions as a Museum, ploppable only, with a plopping cost of 4300, bulldoze cost of 210, and a radius of 680.

    **No Dependencies**, and no Readme file.

    Enjoy!
