  summary: Simville Local Police
  description: |-
    After months of not playing, I restarted the day before yesterday, I downloaded a lot of stuff, organized it, nicely, so I wouldn't end up like last time, when I had to delete them all cause the game just kept crashing and crashing. Anyhow, I started playing and realized that there are few police stations. So, I made one and hopefully I'll make more. Simville Local Police is designed for my little towns on which I'm currently working on. It is a fictional building, with a radius matching the big original Police Department (not the Deluxe one).

    **Stats:**

    Plop cost:                   850

    Montly cost:                200

    Bulldoze cost:           450

    Consumes - power    26

    - water     12

    It has a jail capacity of 70 inmates, enough for any small town (hopefully), has 5 dispatch cars with a radius of 75 tiles.

    There are **no dependencies** and **no Readme**.

    Installation: Just unzip the file in your Plugins Folder.

    **Enjoy!**
