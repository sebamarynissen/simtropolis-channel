  summary: Simville Jail
  description: |-
    Since I released a Local Police Department yesterday, I figured why not make a jail also. So here it is. It's a small one, since town don't really need (hopefully) a capacity larger than 95 inmates. The Jailhouse sits on a 2x2 lot. It cost 680 to plop, and 220 to maintain every month.It consumes 12 power and 6 water.

    There are **no Dependencies** and **no Readme**!

    Enjoy!
