    Not my best work. But figured, since I made it, and export it I thought I'll upload it in case anybody wants it.

    Beyfin Industries is a 23 story high commercial service building, which sits on a 3x3 lot and grows at stage 7. It holds a 3 star hotel for the first 16 stories, and offices for the Beyfin Company at the top 7 stories. Just like the Beyfin Hotel it grows in Chicago and New York style.

    Consumes 71 power, and 74 water. It has a bulldoze cost of 2100, and it constructs in 117 days.

    Pollution: 15 air over 5 tiles

    16 water over 5 tiles

    16 garbage over 0 tiles

    There are **no Dependencies** and **no Readme** file.

    Installation: Just unzip the content in your Plugins folder.

    Enjoy!
