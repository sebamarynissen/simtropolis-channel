  description: |-
    The building is a fictional one, it sits on a 2x2 lot, it can be used as w2w but looks good individually as well. It's a CS$$ building with 119 jobs (468 when CS$), has a bulldoze cost of 300, a construction time of 32 days, and a it grows in every style. It consumes 12 power and 19 water.

    And that's about it.

    As usual, **No dependencies** and **No Readme.**

    Installation: Just unzip the file in your Plugins folder.
