  description: |-
    BLaM French Connections offers the in game Maxis Elementary School with a facelift!

    This school has a pretty, colorful playground, with a non slip surface, and teddy bear paw prints. Included are playthings for the children to enjoy.

    The most important addition, is a safety fence enclosing the playground, ensuring that the children cannot run out into the road, and preventing pedestrians from wandering across the playground

    Stats:

    Lot size: 3 x 3

    All other stats as per the maxis original.

    The unique texture used for the playground, is included within the zip archive, but anyone who has the BLaM FC Teddybear's Park, will already have it, so should delete it from this pack

    To instal

    BLaM recommends the making of a folder named BLaM within your plugins folder. The contents of the folder contained within the download zip archive may then be dragged directly to that folder. Please ensure that you retain both the SC4Lot file and the French connection Paws textures.dat file (if you don't already have it)
