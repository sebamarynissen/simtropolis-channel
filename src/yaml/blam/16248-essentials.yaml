  summary: BLaM Essentials Version 1
  description: |-
    This file contains 91 assorted props that will be used by the BLaM team in forthcoming projects. They cover a wide range of subjects, from flora and fauna, through vehicles, to industrial - plus one or two surprises!

    One of the most important and unique features of these props, and indeed of all future updates to this file, is that the props have been tagged so that, if you instal a BLaM lot that requires a prop, and you do not have the prop installed, a news ticker message will appear in game advising you of this fact! All BLaM releases that use these props will be enabled to do this, so you need never worry about brown boxes again - well not with BLaM releases anyway!

    If you use any of the props in this file for your own releases please do not (without our consent) include the BLaM Essentials file with your release, but instead point users to this file as a dependency.

    **File Tracking**

    As BLaM only ever intend to release two dependency packages - **Essentials** and **Textures**, it will be very important to ensure that you always have the latest version of the packs. For this reason we highly recommend that you track the packs using the File Tracking option above.

    Additionally, if you would like to be advised when a new pack becomes available please feel free to subscribe to the **BLaM Newsletter**. This will be produced at random intervals during the year and will keep you advised of latest updates, news and goings on in the world of BLaM. Subscription to this newsletter does not mean you will be bombarded with spam, but you will be the first to know when new lots are released, and updates are made to the BLaM packs. To subscribe simply send a blank email with the subject "Newsletter Subscription" to [**blam\_newsletter@onlyplace4.com**](mailto:blam_newsletter@onlyplace4.com?subject=Newsletter%20Subscription)

    **To instal**

    We would recommend that you create a folder named BLaM in your plugins folder and then simply unzip the entire folder within the zip file to this folder.

    If you download and use, please comment and rate.
