  summary: Grimes Grimy Recycling
  description: |-
    This is the **first** release from the BLaM team, and only a little one just to get the name on the map, so to speak.

    Gerald Grimes came to town as a child and was always getting dirty, so it only followed that when he grew up he went into the recycling business, and now he's never happier than when he is up to his armpits in other peoples waste! You will, naturally enough, find this one in your Sanitation menu. It has exactly half the capacity of the in game recycling centre, and occupies a 2x2 lot (rather than the 3x2 of the in game recycling centre). This lot does not replace the in game recycling centre, and the two may therefore be used side-by-side is so desired.
