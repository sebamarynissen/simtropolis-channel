  description: |-
    This is a $$$ Commercial service building for SimCity 4 Rush Hour. The name of this building is fictional and so is the building architecture. It employs 128 sims and 4 different lots are included which are all growable.

    To install simply unpack all files to your SimCity 4 plugins folder.

    The building should then pop up in medium/high density zones. Lot sizes include 3x4, 4x3 and two 3x3 lots so it should be able to be built almost anywhere in your cities.

    Enjoy it.....
