  summary: Lower Pedriana Farms Frequency Mod
  description: |-
    I hate those big, ugly Pedriana Plants that develop all over my farms!

    This mod reduces the frequency of the Pedriana Plant farm buildings that is seen in cities one a region is developed, or optionally stops them from developing completely.  
      
    I updated this mod to make it a bit more simple to manage. This now contain only 2 mod files. One "smooths out" the frequency of farms developing, and the other will stop Pedriana from developing at all.

    See the readme for more details.
