  summary: Park And Ride
  description: |-
    These are two transit lots that can be used to either supplement or replace the in-game lots for bus and parking. Actually, only one of the lots is a "park and ride", the other lot I just threw in because I felt like it.

    The BusStation lot is a bus station that also incorporates parking, so that sims can choose to drive to the bus station and then ride the bus from there. It is essentially like a parking garage and a bus station placed side-by-side, but it's smaller and looks much better in low-density areas.

    The bus station is a 2x2 lot. Stats are same as the bus station except it is more expensive to place and to operate ($225 plop and $10/month). This extra cost is to account for the parking.

    (If you're familiar with transit modding...) There is also a 0.05 commute penalty for transit-switching in this lot. This very small amount stops sims from using the lot as a "short cut" across road corners, unnecessarily clogging it up. This happens with the regular in-game mass transit stations as well. There's a thread on the bug elsewhere in the forums. Anyway, a very small commute penalty fixes the problem.

    The Parkinglot lot is simply the same as the regular in-game parking garage, but it has more ground-level parking so that it fits in a little better in low-density areas. It's a 3x3 lot (same as the in-game) and has the same stats. You don't need it to use the park 'n ride bus station lot, of course.

    There are NO dependencies needed for these lots!
