  summary: Lots of Riots Mod
  description: |-
    Some people have played SimCity 4 for quite awhile, and never seen a riot. That's not surprising, since you normally have to have a very unhappy city to create a riot.

    This mod makes riots much more common, so that everyone can experience the chaos of anarchy. It forces you to keep your mayor rating significantly above +50 if you want to prevent riots. If sims in parts of your city drop their rating of you below +50, watch out!

    To install, just unzip and drop into your plugin file. To remove, just delete it from your plugin file. It won't have any impact on your cities once it is removed.
