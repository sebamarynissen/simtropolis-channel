  summary: Turbulences and Transitions Volume 01 and Volume 2
  description: |-
    A set of turbulences for your rivers and streams.  
      
    You'll find narrow and wide pieces, both in straight and diagonal versions. They all sit on a 1x1 transparent lot and can be combined with PEG\-PPond (Tahoe), PEG\-Pond and PEG\-Stream or ploppable waters by other creators as well.

    **LIST OF ITEMS**

    -   Narrow Short Straight
    -   Narrow Long Straight
    -   Narrow Short Diagonal
    -   Narrow Long Diagonal
    -   Wide Short Straight
    -   Wide Long Straight
    -   Wide Short Diagonal
    -   Wide Long Diagonal

    Each piece comes in 2 **variations** that plop at random (16 models all in all).

    **DEPENDENCIES**  
      
    ~ none ~  
      
    Recommended to use with [**Free Waters Mod**](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/26556-free-waters/).

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**  
      
    The turbulences are batted props (instead of the textures used in Vol 01), so there are less straight edges and a bit of overlap onto the next tile.

    You can combine them with any ploppable water and to some extent also with Pond and Stream pieces, mainly the straight items.

    Some of the pieces are also suitable to make transitions between the various available waters - just be creative and find the right combinations.

    There are no other props on these lots - so you have complete freedom to dress them with any Major Mode Flora that suits your theme.

    The **Turbulences and Transitions Volume 01** (texture based) is available to download [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bcgduel3xmz3ah/Turbulence_Transition_102.zip?dl=1) and is now also an option when downloading from this entry.
