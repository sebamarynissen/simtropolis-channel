  summary: Urban Renewal - PURe
  description: |-
    This is going to be sort of a series. Once in a while I will release a fresh lot that you can add to this series, together with a specific model you'll need to download.

    To ensure easy handling and as little confusion as possible, I prepared a little package that you need to install and set up BEFORE you start on this collection - the **PURe Basic Pack**. This particular download does NOT YET contain any lots!

    The package lists a few dependencies - download them all. It also contains a **Resource** file (*\_PURe\_Resource\_KEEP*) - this file will serve ALL future releases of PURe lots and MUST be present in your PURe folder.

    When a new item gets released, just add the fresh lot file and the specified model to your PURe folder and you're all set to go.

    **DEPENDENCIES** (for ALL future PURe Lots)

    -   [Paeng Texture Pack v104](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22823-paeng-textures-vol104/)
    -   [SHK Parking Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27563-shk-parking-pack/)
    -   [Porkie Props Vol 01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11421-porkie-props-vol1-european-street-accessories/)
    -   [SG 01 Mega](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15287-bsc-mega-props-sg-vol-01/)
    -   [SPOT](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24509-spot/) (Orientation Helpers, optional)

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    So once more, step-by-step:

    1.  Make sure all the listed dependencies are in your Plugins.  
        *Nothing exotic, you probably have them all.*
    2.  Download and install the PURe Basic Pack.  
        *This will add the* **PURe\_Resource** *and the folder* **PURe\_Models** *(empty for now).*
    3.  Wait for the first PURe Lot to be released (shortly) :-)

    \* And again - this package does **not** contain any lots. It will serve as a common dependency for future PURe uploads.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Unzip to your Plugins.

    To uninstall, remove the files from your Plugins.
