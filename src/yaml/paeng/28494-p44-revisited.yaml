  summary: P44 Revisited
  description: |-
    Here is my take on the wonderful ***P44 Tower*** by **SimFox**. Due to its small 2x2 footprint the original tower tends to grow like a bush fire, so some players just removed it from their plugins - which is a pity. So in order to tame this wild boy, I made a lot with a much larger footprint sporting four of these towers - two orthogonal and two diagonal (25 and 16 floors with white or brick detailing).

    5x6 RES$$ Stage 6 (*for more stats see developer notes below*)

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    The lot arranges four *P44* towers around a central 'court' with the balconies all facing inward for more privacy. This enables you to grow any number in an irregular pattern (*see additional screenshots*).

    The lot has a few 'tunnels' to suggest underground parking - add parking modules, bus- and subway stops etc. as you desire.

    *Stats*

    \----------------------

    Bulldoze - 3800

    Capacity - 2800 (5200)

    Power/Water - 40/112

    Pollution - 8-12-32-0 (radius 20-24-0-0)

    Worth - 3600

    BuildingValue - 76000

    These values closely follow the originals set by *SimFox*, increased to represent the total of four towers.

    Note that the original packs has 8 models (4 white, 4 brick). They are all used in this lot, with half of them used as 'stacked' props. You will see always four of them, randomized with each newly grown lot.

    You can use this pack standalone - you do not need any of the props, lots or dependencies listed for the original package. Just make sure to load all the original model files.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Put the whole bundle into "(My )Documents/Plugins".

    To un-install - bulldoze all lots you may have plopped from this pack, then remove it completely from your Plugins.
