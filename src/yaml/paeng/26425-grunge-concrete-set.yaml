    Tired of all the plain, uniform, 'clean' looking concrete? Here is a small set of fillers for your industrial areas with some grungy concrete, broken up slabs with grass sticking out...

    **LIST OF ITEMS**

    The set includes basic paths of grungy concrete with tire tracks -

    -   1x1 straight, curve, tee, cross, end
    -   1x1 plain filler
    -   1x1 gated entrance (2 versions, TE'd and eyecandy)

    **BONUS**

    \* a set of Mayor Mode Ploppables (*MMP*) with various industrial props to scatter all over the place ;-)

    **DEPENDENCIES**

    ~ none ~

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    You can use the basic set of lots standalone.

    **The pack also contains a set of textures that will be used as a dependency for my future lotting projects**.

    Lotters - you may use the textures for your own projects. However, please do not include them in your uploads - point to this pack as a dependency instead.

    You find the lots at or near the end of the 'Transportation | Miscellaneous' menu with custom icons.

    The MMP of course sits in your Mayor Mode menu.

    **SUPPORT**
