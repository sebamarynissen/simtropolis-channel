  summary: madhatter106's Surf Shacks re-lotted by Paeng
  description: |-
    This **Surf Shacks** LOT set was made by [@paeng](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/211121-paeng/) and originally was uploaded onto the PLEX (or appeared there as a forum attachment) and hasn't been available according to my best knowledge since then. I made this readme to collect all the dependencies into one place for easier access with updated links.

    **Please note with the permission of the *Simtropolis Staff Members (Cori & Cyclone Boom)* and *Catty-CB*, this file has been uploaded on behalf of Paeng. It was not available anymore due to the unfortunate demise of SimPeg. All the works contained within *this download* (lots and descriptors) were created by Paeng.**

    The original surf shack models and VW buses props were made by [@madhatter106](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/207209-madhatter106/) and you can find them on the provided link in the Dependencies below.

    **Installation:** Unzip the whole bundle, or COPY the "Paeng" folder from the \*.zip into your plugin folder. You don't need to keep the "Documentation" folder. To uninstall, bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.

    **LIST OF ITEMS:**

    \* 1 Cowabunga Board Rental 1x1  
    \* 1 Kahuna Surf Shack 1x1  
    \* 1 Sam's Surf School  
    \* 1 Surfer Parking 1x1

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    [madhatter106's Surf Shacks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21867-surf-shacks/ "Only the Models and the madhatter106_VWbuses.dat")  (the original models)
