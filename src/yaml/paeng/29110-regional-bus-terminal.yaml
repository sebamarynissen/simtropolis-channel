  description: |-
    First of all, the Kudos - to *Voltaire* and *Ace Bovenopdeberg* for creating the fantastic airport props. And to *SimcityFuturist*, who came up with the (brilliant) idea to turn some of them into a large Bus Terminal.

    Now for myself I wanted the terminal more modular (my pet peeve ;-) and also better fitting into a more suburban setting, as the current design rather has a strong 'inner city' feel to it.

    So here is my re-lot of *SimcityFuturist's Regional Bus Terminal* - with a few additional wrinkles... ;-)

    **LIST OF ITEMS**

    \* 14x5 - main Bus Terminal

    \* 14x2 - Bus Parking (large)

    \*  7x2 - Bus Parking (small)

    *See Dev Notes below for more details.*

    **DEPENDENCIES**

    \* **[BLaM Blank](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/17996-blam-blank/) - this is essential to avoid brown boxes wich were reported [into this topic](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/75496-missing-plugin-pack-warning/).**

    \* **[ACB VLT Terminals and Jets Series 1 part 2](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/18479-acb-vlt-terminals-and-jets-series-1-part-2/)**

    *See Readme/Installation Guide for a comprehensive list of needed models!* *- These models and desc were merged and superseeded by the below listed AC Mega Props 2 and 3. You need to run the installer of those and you can keep the files on their originally provided location. - added by Tyberius06*

    \* **[AC MEGA Props Vol02](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1892)** \- *added by Tyberius06*

    \* **[AC MEGA Props Vol03](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1893)** *\- added by Tyberius06*

    \* **[Bus Prop Pack 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21968-bus-prop-pack/) by Glenni**

    *The rest are my usual suspects -*

    \* [SHK Parking Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27563-shk-parking-pack/)

    \* [Paeng Texture Pack v104](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22823-paeng-textures-vol104/)

    \* [SG 01 Megapack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15287-bsc-mega-props-sg-vol-01/)

    \* [Porkie Props Vol 01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11421-porkie-props-vol1-european-street-accessories/)

    \* [Murimk Props Vol02](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/25888-murimk-props-vol02/)

    **UPDATES:**

    1) It was suggested to raise the capacity to 35.000 to be more compatible with NAM values (new: v1.1).

    2) Better texture for pedestrian crossing added (new: v1.2)

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    Once you installed the *ACB VLT Pack*, you'll have a huge chunk (20Mb) of models, props and lots in you plugins - but use barely 10% of them (unless you build those airports as well)... See the included *Installation Guide* (PDF) with a precise listing of the needed items. You'll be able to reduce that complex bundle to a tight 2Mb and free your menus from any items you do not use!

    *So what else is different in this pack?*

    **\* Smaller footprint** - the lot has been resized to 14x5 (before: 14x9).

    **\* Modular** - instead is has now separate Bus Parking (14x2 or 7x2) for more flexible layouts; in tight spots you could even skip them, e.g. to replace them with underground parking or similar.

    **\* More Capacity** - the terminal now has a capacity of 35.000 (before: 1.000), so there should be no more traffic jams.

    *Note: Capacity was raised in v1.1*

    **\* Added COM Boost** - it also gives a slight boost to nearby COM.

    **\* Added Jobs** - the additional Bus Parking has no traffic switches, but generates some jobs (80 or 40 CS$$). Naturally, you can also use the Bus Parking strips as standalone items (without the Terminal). If you do so, plop any Bus Stop(s) of your choice to provide traffic switching capabilities.

    **\* Mac Capacity Bug** - fixed in this version.

    **\* Complete re-lot** - to match the new footprint. Gives it a less 'inner city' feeling, so it's also suitable for more suburban areas.

    **\* Reduced dependencies** - you can skip the *SimFox Trees, BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01, BSC MEGA Props CP Vol02, VIP CarPack vol1*... even the *NAM* is not mandatory any more. Big deal, you might say - but hey, less dependencies always feels safer - after all, we never know what the guy next door uses (or not)... ;-)

    **\* MMP friendly occupant sizes** - to add more trees and greenery, just use any from your own arsenal of MMPs.

    You find all items at or near the end of the *'Transportation | Miscellaneous'* menu.

    **INSTALLATION**

    Unzip the whole bundle into *"(My )Documents/Plugins"*.

    To uninstall, bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.

    **CREDITS**

    Thanks to the folks at simpeg.com for valuable feedback! :-)

    **Enjoy!**

    **\-Cori Edit:** Added missing Murimk Props Vol02 dependency linky and tidied up the formatting a little bit.

    *\- Tyberius06 edit on 23.10.2018 - updated dependency links with the missing and essential **[blank building](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/17996-blam-blank/).***
