  summary: Grunge IND Alleys
  description: |-
    Sometimes we would like to have a sizable area that is not criss-crossed by uniform streets and roads... but we can't because in most cases we then lack road-access for the lots. This set offers a bag-of-tricks to get around that, so you can make apparently un-connected open spaces - useful for industrial compounds, warehouse districts, waterfronts, large parking areas and more.  
      
      
    **LIST OF ITEMS**  
      
    \* 3 transit-enabled Extenders (straight, cross, Tee)  
    \* 2 transit-enabled gates  
      
    \* 3 perimeter fence sections (1x, 3x, curve)  
    \* 2 under-bridge extenders (left, right)  
      
      
    **DEPENDENCIES**  
      
    \* [Murimk Prop Pack Vol03 - Industrials](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27698-murimk-prop-pack-vol03-industrials/)  
      
    \* [Grunge Concrete Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26425-paengs-grunge-concrete-set/)  
      
    \* [PEG Security Fencing Kit](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19338-peg-security-fencing-kit/)  
      
    \* [SHK Parking Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27563-shk-parking-pack/)  
      
    \* [SPOT](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24509-spot/) (Orientation Helpers, optional)  
      
      
    **DEVELOPER NOTES**  
      
    **[See a demo](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/forum/index.php?topic=10745.msg218801#msg218801)** on how to use the TE extenders here!  
      
    The lots are mostly neutral and cheap to plop. The apparent lack of props and lotted items is on purpose - players are supposed to have most possible freedom in designing their own scenes using IND lots, fillers and MMPs (i.e. *Murimk Prop Pack Vol03*, *GridBusters* and similar items). That should help building dedicated IND areas... Be creative ;-)  
      
    You can get additional visual interest by using different streetside mods and SAM streets (the core set also works as an effective 'SAM Stopper')... A bit challenging at times, but well worth the effort.  
      
    You find all items at or near the end of the *'Transit | Misc'* menu with custom icons.  
      
      
    **INSTALLATION**  
      
    Unzip the whole bundle into *"(My )Documents/Plugins"*.  
    To uninstall, bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.  
      
      
    **CREDITS**  
      
    Thanks to the folks at simpeg.com for valuable feedback! :-)
