  summary: PEG-PPOND Tahoe Three Pontoon Boats
  description: |-
    This PEG\-PPOND Tahoe Pontoon Boats was made by Paeng and originally was uploaded as a forum attachment onto the PLEX and **hasn't been available** according to my best knowledge. I made this readme to collect all the dependencies into one place for easier access with updated links.

    **Please note with the permission of the *Simtropolis Staff Members (Cori & Cyclone Boom)* and *Catty-CB*, this file has been uploaded on behalf of Paeng. It was not available anymore due to the unfortunate demise of SimPeg. All the works in this download were created by Paeng.**

    **LIST OF ITEMS:**

    \* 3 1x1 Lots with offset boat props and transparent textures.

    **Installation:**

    Unzip the whole bundle, or COPY the "Paeng" folder from the \*.zip into your plugin folder. You don't need to keep the "Documentation" folder. To uninstall, bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.
