  summary: Sandstone Parks (Beta)
  description: |-
    -   This **Paeng's SandStone Parks (beta)** was made by Paeng and originally was uploaded as a forum attachment onto the PLEX and **hasn't been available** according to my best knowledge.
    -   **Disclaimer on BETA:** As I see, he was about to make and release with its official release a few "raised/slope wall" parks too (you can find an expanded image into the **Documentation Folder** of this upload OR you can check the 2nd picture above, which shows you how they would've been look like, and an explanation about his dissatisfaction with the lots). I think (**my personal opinion**), he actually cancelled the release of these lots, because you can find all the 1x1 lots to be made as functional PED MALLs under the release **[Paeng's PedMall Parks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26454-paengs-pedmall-parks/)**.
    -   **Please note with the permission of the *Simtropolis Staff Members (Cori & Cyclone Boom)* and *Catty-CB*, this file has been uploaded on behalf of Paeng. It was not available anymore due to the unfortunate demise of SimPeg. All the works in this download were created by Paeng.**
    -   **Installation:** Unzip the whole bundle, or COPY the "Paeng" folder from the \*.zip into your plugin folder. You don't need to keep the "Documentation" folder. To uninstall, bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.

    -   **LIST OF ITEMS:**

    1.  \* 13 various 1x1 fillers, small parks and walkways (see the attached picture)

    1.  \* 1 2x2 medium plaza park

    1.  \* 1 3x3 large plaza park
