  summary: MTP Logging AddOn Vol02
  description: |-
    To further strengthen the logging operations in your region, here is a second MTP\-style addon. It refreshes many previous items and adds a number of new ones as well. Most of it lives off old proven dependencies, but a few new ones had to be added - see the 'checklist' below...

    **LISTING OF ITEMS**

    **Logging Roads v2**

    \* 16 lots with various configurations, stacked log props, timed vehicles

    **Log and Lumber Storage**

    \* 10 lots with various configurations, stacked lumber props, timed vehicles

    **Logging Facilities** (functional)

    \* Storage Headquarter I-D

    \* Poor Old Sawmill I-D

    \* Slaytfork Mill Revisited I-M

    \* Logging Freight Station RR

    \* Container Generator UTIL

    **Miscellaneous Logging Items**

    \* 9 Lots (Fillers) with various configurations, stacked props, timed vehicles

    **Others**

    \* Various Replacement files and Patches for existing items

    **DEPENDENCIES**

    If you are new to 'Logging', you may want to check this very comprehensive ["Cheat Sheet"](https://community.simtropolis.com/omnibus/simcity-4/reference/paengs-cheat-sheet-logging-operations-in-rural-areas-r386/) listing **everything** you need for a successful logging operation!

    This pack is not meant to be a 'standalone' set but was done to enhance and fill out our existing logging collection... If you're a Logger, I'm quite positive that you don't really need to download/install anything... it's all there. So this is more of a checklist ;-)

    \* [**NBVC Logging Set**](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/27240-logging-set/)

    **\* [MTP Super Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/)**

    **\* [PEG MTP Logging Industry RESOURCE](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20965-peg-mtp-logging-resource/)**

    **\* [PEG MTP LTUSA Cross Roads](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21147-peg-mtp-ltusa-cross-roads/)**

    **\* [PEG MTP TLC Rail Transfer Yard](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21072-peg-mtp-tlc-rail-transfer-yard/)**

    **\* [PEG\-MTP Logging Roads](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21053-peg-mtp-logging-roads/)** (needed: PEG\-MTP\_Logging-Roads\_Textures101.dat)

    **\* [PEG\-MTP LTUSA Container Generator](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21103-peg-mtp-ltusa-container-generator/)**

    \* [**Nexis Woodpile Props**](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/11769-nexis-wood-pile-props/)

    **\* [Paeng's Grunge Concrete Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26425-paengs-grunge-concrete-set/)**

    **\* [SPOT (Orientation Helpers)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24509-spot/)**

    \* **MTP\_Logging\_Resource\_ADD.dat** (included)

    \* **zz\_MTP\_Logging\_Patches.dat** (included)

    **OPTIONAL**

    **Poor Old Sawmill**

    \* [**Newman Inc. Props Vol.01**](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=613)
    (*same as for the sawmills included in 'NBVC Logging Set'*)

    **The Revisited Slaytfork Set**

    \* [**Slaytfork Mill Revised**](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/15907-slaytfork-mill-revised/)
    (*needed: Slaytfork Mill Revised.dat*)

    \* [**Slaytfork Accomodation**](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/15246-logging-mill-accomodation/)
    (*needed: Slaytfork accomodation.dat*)

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    The bulk of the lots is found tightly grouped with custom icons in the 'Transport | Miscellaneous' menu. Power and Rail items are in their respective menus.

    **Logging Roads** (partial Replacement)

    Replace OLD \* PEG\-MTP\_Logging-Roads\_101.dat

    with NEW \* MTP\_LoggingRoads\_v200.dat

    Note: The original textures (PEG\-MTP\_Logging-Roads\_Textures101.dat) MUST be kept!

    **Logging Scenes** (Replacement)

    Replace OLD \* PEG\-MTP\_MM7-ForestLogging\_MOD\_103.dat (in: ZZZ PEG Facelift Mods >MTP >MTP MM7 Logging Scenes)

    with NEW \* PEG\-MTP\_MM7-ForestLogging\_MOD\_200.dat

    Note: The replacement file has additional items needing some dependencies/patches as listed above.

    **Logging Patches**

    These patches are optional - there are some adjustments to the included exemplars, but mainly they will assure full 'paintability' of all items (meaning you can brush in MMP flora around and below plopped items). Make sure to keep them in a z-folder in your Plugin's root, insuring that they load AFTER any logging items, regardless of the creator (e.g. PEG, NBVC, NEXIS etc.).

    \* *See also ReadMe files in the corresponding folders.*

    **THANKS!**

    Special khanks go to all who sponsored custom props for this pack - **Nexis, Becca and Murimk**. Unless noted otherwise these items are included in the resource file, with their kind permission.

    **SUPPORT**

    Should you need support for these items please visit the [**Paeng Productions forum**](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/forum/index.php?topic=10049.0). The thread shows many additional images as well.

    **\-Cori Edit:** Fixed formatting and broken linkys.
