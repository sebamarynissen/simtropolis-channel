#     AddOn for 'PEG Coast Guard Station'

#     So you finally earned the right to build your Coast Guard Station... and soon you may want to expand on that. Well, give them an airfield. This highly modular set enables you to make your base even more of a region's highlight! Build an air strip with hangars, additional helipads, more barracks and numerous small facilities.

#     Before you wonder - no, this is NOT a functional airport... this airfield will be used only by the coast guard (though once in a while some military choppers might visit).

#     And mind you - this babe ain't cheap! Make sure you got the cash to build it. The full-fledged air field can easily cost you up to 20000! Once built it doesn't cost much to maintain though, you probably get away with a little over a 100 bucks... depending on the size of your runway.

#     \---------------------------------  
#     List of Included Sections  
#     \---------------------------------

#     -   4 runway
#     -   4 taxiways
#     -   7 sidings
#     -   3 structures

#     The set can be used by itself, but makes much more sense together with the 'PEG Coast Guard Station'. An exception to that might be the runways and taxiways - those can be used to build a landing strip of any type, anywhere...

#     Btw: The runways are made up of Maxis default items - so yes, the level or realism may be questioned by some. But no, you don't need to be a trained pilot to build them - which will probably suit most :-))

#     All pieces need power and water.

#     All of them can be found at or near the end of your 'Landmarks Menu'.
