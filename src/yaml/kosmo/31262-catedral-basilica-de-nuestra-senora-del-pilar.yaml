  summary: Catedral-Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar
  description: |-
    The Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (Spanish: *Catedral-Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar*) is a Roman Catholic church in the city of Zaragoza, Spain. The Basilica venerates Blessed Virgin Mary, under her title Our Lady of the Pillar, praised as *Mother of the Hispanic Peoples* by Pope John Paul II. It is reputed to be the first church dedicated to Mary in history.

    Local traditions take the history of this basilica to the dawn of Christianity in Spain attributing to apparition to Saint James the Great the Apostle *(Tradition holds that on 2 January 40 AD, while he was deep in prayer by the banks of the Ebro river at the roman city of Caesaraugusta, She appeared to him and gave a column of jasper and instructed him to build a church in her honor)* who is believed by tradition to have brought Christianity to the country. This is the only reported apparition of Mary to have occurred before her believed Assumption.

    The temple was built between the 1st century AD (first roman temple) and 1961 (north tower completion), passing by many architectonic styles and several enlargements.
