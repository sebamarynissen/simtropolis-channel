    It works like a decorative landmark. Plop the lot directly on water.

    Due to the size of the model, it has been divided in several props and some shadows has been lost, among others little things. I will continue working and I will try to improve it.

    All dependencies / props are included into the zip, just unzip and copy the entire folder into plugin's one and enjoy!
