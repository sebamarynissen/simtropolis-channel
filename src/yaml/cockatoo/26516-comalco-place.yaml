    **Cockatoo Presents…**

    **Comalco Place**

    ***Model, Modding / Lotting & Readme – Cockatoo.***

    ***And a special thanks to everyone in the*** ***BAT*** ***forums who pushed me to go further with this one…***

    ***Overview:***

    Saw this one on the way home from uni one day and thought I might make it, It’s an office tower located in the heart of Brisbane. The tower is mostly accurate, with aspects of the base invented to better suit the game.

    I’ve included a Dark truNite model for day/night mod users in addition to a regular Maxis truNite model for those who don’t.

    In this download there are three versions included.

    -   Growable stage 8 CO§§ providing 4633 medium wealth jobs. (CAMpatible)
    -   Plopable functional CO§§ providing 4633 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Plopable static landmark.

    ***The stats are as follows:***

    Stats are in the readme file.

    ***Dependencies:***

    These lots require no dependency files.

    ***Installation:***

    Copy the Cockatoo folder into the Plugins folder. Select whether to use the Maxis Nite (MN) or Dark Nite (DN) version, deleting the MN or DN folders accordingly.

    -   CO$8\_6x3\_Comalco Place.SC4Lot = Growable CO§§
    -   PLOP\_CO$\_6x3\_Comalco Place.SC4Lot = Plopable CO§§
    -   PLOP\_6x3\_Comalco Place.SC4Lot = Landmark

    ***Problem, Officer?***

    If you experience any problems, don't hesitate to send me a message.
