  summary: WTC Complex - SC4D LEX Legacy - World Trade Plaza
  description: |-
    **Cockatoo Presents…**

    **World** **Trade** **Plaza**

    *Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    *Original models – Rubik3 and the BSC team.*

    ***Overview:***  In the original upload of the World Trade Centre complex, there are three black plaza buildings (WTC’s 4, 5 & 6) that fill out the area around the base of the two towers. These buildings have always looked great on that lot, but sometimes are obscured by the towers themselves, so I’ve created a lot where two these buildings (WTC’s 4 & 5) can be seen clearly. They’re positioned on a sprawling plaza lot that should easily fit into any downtown or commercial district.

    I’ve modded two versions, the first, World Trade Plaza, is a plopable commercial that provides a good amount of medium-wealth jobs and the second, World Trade Park, provides a park effect that should encourage commercial growth.

    These lots were made with the X\_Tool, so they don’t spread malaria to third world countries!

    In this download there are two versions included:

    -   Plopable functional COS§§ providing 4310 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Plopable park lot.

    For those who use Submenu DLL and have WTC Complex - SC4D LEX Legacy - BSC Custodian Rubik, you can find the lots in the WTC Submenu.
