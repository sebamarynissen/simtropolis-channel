    If you’re clever, you’ll have noticed that this is a re-make of my first BAT ever released, the Yau Ma Tei Currency Exchange. There are, however, so many improvements to the textures, model and night-lighting of the building, that I’ve decided to release it under a different name.

    **Overview:** The Mok Tin-Yin building is a fantasy building created in the Hong Kong street style of architecture. It’s typical of any district of Kowloon, with working class office space in the floors above and ratty street side shops underneath. To add to the realism of this BAT, overhanging neon sings have been added to the sides of the bottom floor, when you plop this in, be sure to make sure that the street sings hang over the streets as they were intended to, otherwise they may get cut off by another building.
