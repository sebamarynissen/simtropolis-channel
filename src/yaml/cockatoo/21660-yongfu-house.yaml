    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents…**

    **Yongfu House**

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:**  I give you the product of my three day intense BATing session, Yongfu House. No, this isn’t a re-creation of an actual Hong Kong skyscraper, it’s essentially my own design, but I based many aspects of it on one particular building in Wan Chai, so yea, this dose qualify as a Hong Kong style building. This is also my first release of a model I’ve created entirely in 3dsmax, so it includes heaps of the stuff I’ve always wanted to do, but never could. Sorry if you’re not a fan of neon lighting, it’s my new favourite toy…

    Also note that the plopable versions overhang their 2x2 lots (this is intended, they’re diagonals) so make sure you place diagonal roads or streets around them when you use them in the game. The growable version is on a 4x4 lot and dose not overhang, so won’t overlap any buildings it grows adjacent to.
