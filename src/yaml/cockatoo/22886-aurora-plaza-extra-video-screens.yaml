  summary: Aurora Plaza-Extra Video Screens
  description: |-
    At your request, here are three extra versions of the video screen for Aurora Plaza. You can now choose between the Geisha from Blade Runner, a few bottles of Heineken or the Coca-Cola logo, as well as the Dear Leader and the no screen version from the original download.

    There are no .SC4Lot files included in this download, only .SC4Model files. If you havenâ€™t already, [download the original Aurora Plaza](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=22876) and extract your desired .SC4Lot files to your plugins folder. Then select your model file from this download and extract that. As these models, as well as the ones in the original download, were all exported from a single .SC4Model file (that is they all have the same TGI), you can only use one version at a time, however you can switch them around at anytime without any consequences in game. In short, they're different versions of exactly the same model.

    Just delete your old model and plug in a new one, simple as that!

    Enjoy.
