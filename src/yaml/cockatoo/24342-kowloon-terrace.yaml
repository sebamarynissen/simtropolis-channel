    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents…**

    **Kowloon Terrace**

    Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.

    * * *

    **Overview:**  Kowloon Terrace is a mid-sized Kowloon style multiuse building (shops on the ground floor – apartments or accommodation higher up) based on something I saw Cowkilla making years ago in his BAT thread. Unfortunately, Cowkilla never finished his version, so I decided to make my own. Although the model is 100% my own, and I have made some significant changes, credit goes to him for the original core design.

    If anyone can read Chinese, please let me know what those various neon signs on the side of the building say! I’ll admit I have no idea; most of them were just randomly lifted from Google street view.

    This model has been rendered in HD, that is, when viewed at zoom 6, the model appears at a much higher resolution than standard definition buildings. This is intended to show more detail and make certain things readable, however it also results in a much higher filesize. If your plugins folder is already bursting at the brim, I’d suggest not using, or clearing space, for this download.

    I’ve also included a Dark truNite model for day/night mod users in addition to a regular Maxis truNite model for those who don’t.

    In this download there are three versions included:

    -   Growable stage 6 CS§§ providing 409 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Growable stage 11 CS§§ providing 1086 medium wealth jobs (**CAM**)
    -   Growable stage 6 CS§ providing 1628 low wealth jobs.
    -   Growable stage 6 R§ providing 1311 low wealth residents
    -   Plopable functional CS§§ providing 1086 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Plopable static landmark.

    **The stats are as follows:**

    It's all in the README.

    **Dependencies:**

    These are the files you need for these lots to be able to function in the game…

    • None!

    **Installation:**

    Copy the HKBAT folder into the Plugins folder. Select whether to use the Maxis Nite (MN) or Dark Nite (DN) version, deleting the MN or DN folders accordingly.

    If you want to use the CAM version, you must also copy the CAM folder.
