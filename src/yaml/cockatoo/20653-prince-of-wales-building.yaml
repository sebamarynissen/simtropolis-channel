    **Overview:**  The Chinese People's Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building (abbreviated as PLA Forces Hong Kong Building) is a 113 metre, 28 floor building located within the former HMS Tamar naval base on Lung Wui Road, Admiralty, Hong Kong. It serves as the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison. The building is still popularly known by its old name as the Prince of Wales Building. (From Wikipedia)

    Yes, at long last I’ve finally finished the first BAT I ever started – The Prince of Wales building. I’ve decided to stick with its original name for this re-creation because the new name is annoyingly long. As per usual, this building has been slightly scaled up to fit more neatly on its lot, but otherwise is a near accurate representation of the real life building for SC4.

    These lots were made with the X\_Tool, so they don’t send ur Hard Drive sky high!
