    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents…**  
    **Harbour Centre - Great Eagle Centre**  
      
    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:**  The Harbour Centre (Olympus) and Great Eagle Centre (Allianz) complex is a set of near identical glass and steel towers connected at the base - located in the Wanchai district of Hong Kong, China.  They both top out at 146m high and were completed in 1983. As usual, these models for SC4 were slightly scaled up – by about 10 – 15% so that some of the detail can be made out more clearly, but otherwise are a mostly accurate re-creation of the real life buildings. These lots were made with the X\_Tool, soo th3y dont flood ur citieh with radiations and lik heaps of pollution and stuff!!  
      
    For various reasons, these towers had to be individually rendered and made into props – and from there were raised up and put on top of the base in the lot editor. This means that when you plop them, they grow in height! The footprint always shows props at ground level until they have actually been plopped, so the towers don’t rise up until you have clicked. Don’t be fooled by the stubby footprint!  
    There is also a hidden message that can sometimes be seen when the footprint is up, see if you can find it…
