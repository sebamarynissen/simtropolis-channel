    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents…**

    **AIG Tower**

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:**  After what, two years, the long awaited AIG Tower has finally arrived. Let’s be honest, my first attempt at this building was, although well received, horrible. I’d only been BATing for a few months and the model itself was heavily flawed. However, with two years experience now under my belt, I can now finally do this building justice. I won’t bother listing the improvements made to the first version because, well, there isn’t a single thing that hasn’t been improved - it’s a totally new model made with a totally different program. The main points are that the model is now accurately shaped, scaled, textured and has night lighting that resembles that of the real building.

    As we all know, since I started this project, the world has endured its greatest financial trouble since the great depression. Because of this, AIG lost its Hong Kong offices and the building is now called AIA Central. However, this project was started when AIG still had the offices (and I’m too lazy to re-name all my files!) so I’m sticking with the name and logo of AIG.

    I payed attention to real life when making the model, and I also payed attention when modding it! Be warned, AIG is a troubled company these days! They have greedy executives who need like to spend all their shareholders money on gold watches and private jets and you’ll pay for this! Expect to fork out a ridiculous amount of money every month to ‘bail out AIG’ when using the landmark lot.
