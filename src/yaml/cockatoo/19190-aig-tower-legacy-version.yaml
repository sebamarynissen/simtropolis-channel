    ****Overview:****

    The Hong Kong AIG Tower is a 185m high, 40 floors office tower located on the corner of Connaught and Charter roads in the Central District of Hong Kong, China. Its unique curved design inspired by a traditional part of Hong Kong life, the Chinese sail boat makes the building really stand out amongst the rest of the Hong Kong skyline and its coloured neon lights that run down the left hand side of building and light up at night during the nightly laser show almost make this building seem to glow as seen from Tsim Sha Tsui. Construction on this tower was started in 2003 and completed in 2005 and was constructed on the former site of Furama Hall building.
