    Asakusa Tourist Centre

    by Cockatoo

    Originally modelled for separate project, I've brought my rough re-creation the Asakusa Tourist Centre (Asakusa, Japan) to SimCity 4. I’ve made available a Dark truNite model for day/night mod users in addition to a regular Maxis truNite model for those who don’t, select your version after pressing the download button. Models have also been exported in HD for your zoom-6 viewing pleasure.

    Three lots are available: A growable stage 5 CS§§§ providing 24 medium wealth jobs, a plopable functional CS§§§ providing 24 high wealth jobs and a plopable static landmark. All fit nicely onto a 1x1 left-hand corner lot.

    There are no dependencies.

    Copy the Cockatoo folder into the Plugins folder. Select whether to use the Maxis Nite (MN) or Dark Nite (DN) version, deleting the MN or DN folders accordingly.

    Post problems in the comments section, or send me a PM. If your nightlights aren't working (yeah, I get a lot of messages about this), please make sure you've updates your game.

    Cheers!

    Cockatoo.
