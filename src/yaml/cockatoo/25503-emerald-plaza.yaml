    Cheers to Amthaak for help with the pool!

    ***Overview:***

    Taking a break from my usual HK stuff, I decided to make this. Emerald plaza is a building located in San Diego, California, consisting of 8 conjoined hexagonal towers. The building features a unique display of neon lighting around the edges of its roof in real life, which I’ve tried my best to re-create in the model.

    I’ve included a Dark truNite model for day/night mod users in addition to a regular Maxis truNite model for those who don’t.

    In this download there are three versions included.

    -   Growable stage 7 CO§§ providing 3147 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Growable stage 9 CO§§ providing 6292 medium wealth jobs (**CAM**)
    -   Plopable functional CO§§ providing 6292 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Plopable static landmark.

    ***The stats are as follows:***

    It's all in the README.

    ***Dependencies:***

    These are the files you need for these lots to be able to function in the game…

    •   None!

    ***Installation:***

    Copy the Cockatoo folder into the Plugins folder. Select whether to use the Maxis Nite (MN) or Dark Nite (DN) version, deleting the MN or DN folders accordingly.

    This package also includes the Christmas version of the building, but only for the DN version.

    If you want to use the CAM version, you must also copy the CAM folder.

    -   CO$$9\_4x6\_Emerald Plaza.SC4Lot = *Growable CO§§*  CAMeLot - you will find it on the
