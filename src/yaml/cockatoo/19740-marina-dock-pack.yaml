    Hong Kong Marina Dock Pack

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:** To add to the realism of your Asian harbour cities, I’ve created a Hong Kong marina set. This download contains 2 Plopable Marina Docks. They have been fully tested by me, and there is absolutely no water graphics bug or missing base texture bug on these lots, I’ve properly removed all the base textures in the reader so you won’t experience any problems. Further more, you don’t even need to connect these lots to a power supply to see the night-lighting. I’ve also made the foundations invisible, so they can be placed over a coastline (on the beach) and you won’t get any of those ugly lot foundations showing up.

    These lots were designed to have little to no impact on the surrounding city. They don’t use any Power or Water; they don’t generate Garbage or any type of Pollution and they don’t have any Occupants. Both lots have the same stats...

    **The stats are as follows:**

    **Monthly Cost:** §15

    **Plop Cost:** §100

    **Bulldoze Cost:** §100

    **Flammability:** 10 (Stage 1)

    **Park Effect:** 30 / 50 tiles

    **Landmark Effect:** 20 / 5 tiles

    **Menu Position:** Water Transit (grouped together near top)

    **Dependencies:**

    None, everything is included.

    However I highly recommended that you use one of [PEG’s water mods](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=11836), so you can see the under-water parts of some of these lots. The standard game water is not translucent enough.

    **Installation:**

    Copy and paste the Hong Kong Marina Dock Pack.dat and the MarinaExtraProps.dat files into your C: MyDoccuments/SimCity4/Plugins folder.

    **How to Use:**

    If you haven’t already gotten the [Junker Ship Pack](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=19739) and the [Marina Wall](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=19741), go get them now.

    Around your coastline, or wherever you want to place these, make sure your water is fairly shallow, about this depth.

    Select the marina wall and position it somewhere out to sea, and then add your docks somewhere around it.

    ![HowToUse2 - 7010b-5513.jpg](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2022_03/623346ce5611d_HowToUse2-7010b-5513.jpg.908b73f217d06202ed3d6e634c131cd4.jpg)

    [http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p11/ParrotsSC4Photos/HowToUse2.jpg](http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p11/ParrotsSC4Photos/HowToUse2.jpg)

    Complete your marina. The marina wall can also be used as a land / sea wall.

    ![HowToUse3 - 7010b-5514.jpg](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2022_03/623346d07b2fe_HowToUse3-7010b-5514.jpg.8df07fbfdf2bfa434e821fdc518f020f.jpg)

    [http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p11/ParrotsSC4Photos/HowToUse3.jpg](http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p11/ParrotsSC4Photos/HowToUse3.jpg)

    Then you can add in the Junker ships, just plop them anywhere around the marina or even on the beach if you want to.
