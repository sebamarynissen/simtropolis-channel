    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents**

    HK Admiralty Centre

    *Model, Modding / Lotting and Readme created by Cockatoo-210893*

    With thanks to kelistmac for the STEX pictures.

    **Overview:** The Admiralty Centre is an office complex made up of two glass and steel towers, Admiralty Centre One - which is the taller of the two at 35 floors and currently has a Principal advertisement on its roof and Admiralty Centre Two - the smaller tower at 28 floors which shows a Gome advertisement. They were constructed in 1980 and were built on the former site of the old colonial British navy headquarters which is why the Admiralty district is called what it is. They are located on Harcourt Road in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong, China and can be clearly recognized as part of the world famous Hong Kong skyline.

    Because these towers are, in real life, very close to some of the other HK buildings released by Paulvmontfort on the STEX, I have included reflections of some of them in the glass of these towers.

    This re-creation of the Admiralty Centre for SC4 is fairly accurate, with the exception of a few items that I’ve modeled into the base just to make it look a little more interesting. All versions sit on an accurately scaled 9x4 lot so that they can line up with some of the other buildings released by the HKABT.

    **Dependencies:**

    If you wish to see the Christmas Tree prop that appears on the lot during the in game Christmas Season then you will need the Rockefeller Centre landmark from the official Maxis website that can be found here. (Note this is an optional dependency, you don’t need this for the lot to function correctly or to avoid brown boxes):

    [http://SimCity.ea.com/coolstuff/landmarks/index.php](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/coolstuff/landmarks/index.php)

    **Installation:**

    Simply copy the HKBAT folder into the Plugins folder.

    **Notes on growing this lot:**

    If you want to see this lot grow in the game, then you must specifically zone the required 9x4 size lots or else you will never see it appear. To do this, hold down ‘Crtl’ while zoning and press ‘G’ to turn on the grid.
