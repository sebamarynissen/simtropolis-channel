    Admiralty Centre Revisited

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:** The Admiralty Centre is an office complex made up of two glass and steel towers, Admiralty Centre One - which is the taller of the two at 35 floors and currently has a Principal advertisement on its roof and Admiralty Centre Two - the smaller tower at 28 floors which shows a Gome advertisement. They were constructed in 1980 and were built on the former site of the old colonial British navy headquarters which is why the Admiralty district is called what it is. They are located on Harcourt Road in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong, China and can be clearly recognized as part of the world famous Hong Kong skyline.

    Some improvements to the previous version are:

    • An improved window texture with less recognisable reflections for those who did not like them.

    • Many small improvements to the base for an overall better appearance.

    • Totally re-worked night-lighting including neon signs.

    • Complex rendered as a whole to avoid problems with towers as props etc.

    • Smaller lot size with less wastage.

    This download is *now* a near accurate representation of the real life building for SC4.

    Note that this version is totally compatible version one, you can have both installed at the same time, or delete the old one if you wish.

    These lots were made with the X\_Tool, so they don’t change your signature image without your permission!
