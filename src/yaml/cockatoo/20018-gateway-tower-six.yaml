    HK Gateway Tower Six

    *Model, Modding / Lotting and Readme created by Cockatoo-210893*

    * * *

    **Overview:** Gateway Tower Six is an office and shopping complex located in the Harbour City Development of Tsim Sha Tsui, in Kowloon, Hong Kong. At 129m tall (35 floors including the base), it has been notable part of the Tsim Sha Tsui skyline along with the rest of the gateway towers since their completion in the 1990’s.

    This re-creation for SC4 has been slightly scaled up to fit on a 6x4 lot, however it is in most ways accurate to the real life building.
