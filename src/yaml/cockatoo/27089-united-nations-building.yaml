    ***Overview:***

    Finally… it’s done. After 18 months of modelling, texturing, lighting, rendering, problems, more problems, hotfixes and caffeine, it gives me great pleasure to finally be able to share with you the fruits of our labour!

    The United Nations Building (or Headquarters) was constructed on a dedicated site overlooking the banks of New York City's East River to house the newly formed body in the wake of the Second World War. An icon of modernist Architecture, the complex was collaboratively designed by a group of leading Architects of the period, including Oscar Niemeyer and even the famed Le Corbusier. At the time of its construction, the complex was revolutionary in both building techniques and design, being one of the first constructions in the world to sport a sleek modernist exterior that is now common in cities all over the world. Aside from occasional renovations and several additional structures, the complex remains in much the same state today as it did almost 60 years ago.

    Done in much the same spirit as the real world building, we set out to recreate the massive complex collaboratively. The foundations were laid out in Australia with building plans being flown in from Finland. The glass, marble and asphalt were all imported from the United States and the fountain was especially made in France. This really was an international effort.

    Just fitting into a single model file, the complex measures an enormous 18x11 SC4 tiles, making it one of the largest modes to ever be exported for this game. Additionally, weighing in at a massive 14.5 million polygons as well as utilising many of 3ds Max's more advanced features, it's also one of the heaviest models ever exported, requiring no less than 8GB of memory to resolve.

    We tried our best to re-create the complex with as much attention to detail and accuracy as possible, and we hope you'll enjoy seeing our creation in your cities.
