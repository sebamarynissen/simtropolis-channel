    **Grow the Empire State Building**

    *Modding / Lotting & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:**  While browsing through some of my older cities today, I suddenly thought…  “How great would it be to see that Empire State Building growing right out of my downtown, instead of having to plop in that lifeless landmark all the time”… I searched the STEX to see if there was a lot available, but there wasn’t.

    Hence this very small download, my Growable Empire State Building.

    With 8940 medium wealth commercial office jobs, it is relatively easy to grow with a standard Rush Hour city; it should appear around the same as the high end Maxis commercial office towers. Be sure to zone the appropriate 8x4 tile area (hold down +Ctrl while zoning) and enable either the Chicago or New York tilesets.

    **The stats are as follows:**

    **GROWABLE CO§§**

    **Size:**  8x4

    **Occupants:**  CO§§ 8940

    **Growth Stage:**  Stage 8

    **Zone Type:**  High Density Commercial

    **Tilesets:**  Chicago & New York

    **Power Used:**  183 MWh per Month

    **Dependencies:**

    These are the files you need for this lot to be able to function in the game…

    None Today. The Empire State Building model and all the props / textures used on this lot come standard with SimCity 4.

    **Installation:**

    Copy the Cockatoo folder into the Plugins folder.

    If you are looking for the descriptor file (.SC4Desc), it has been merged into the lot file for added convenience.
