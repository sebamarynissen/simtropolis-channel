    *BAT, LOT and the rest of it by Cockatoo-210893*

    ****Overview:****

    The Yau Ma Tei Currency Exchange building is based on many different aspects of real life Hong Kong buildings but is not an actual re-creation. Its modern design mixed with low wealth (dirty) textures and overhanging Chinese street sings creates a Hong Kong atmosphere and when mixed with the Asian City Block pack it can look very realistic to HK backstreets. I called it the Yau Ma Tei Currency Exchange because most of the sings on the side of the buildings were made from photos of the Yau Ma Tei district of Kowloon, HK and the currency exchange part comes into it because Hong Kong has a currency exchange on every second corner so their gonna need a head office somewhere!
