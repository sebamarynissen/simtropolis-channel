    **The Hong Kong/ Asia BAT Team Presents…**

    **Aurora Plaza**

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    * * *

    **Overview:**  Aurora Plaza is a big shiny tower in Shanghai. In real life, at night, it features a 15 story high video screen on its front facade, but because not *everybody* wants to see a giant depiction of a puppet Kim Jong Il in their cities, I’ve included two versions of the model. The no screen version features brighter orange night-lighting (which I think looks better) while the screen version has dimmer green lighting and of course, the giant video screen, similar to that of the real building.

    In this download there are three versions included:

    -   Growable Stage 8 CO§§ providing 3355 medium wealth jobs.
    -   Plopable functional CO§§ providing 3355 medium wealth jobs.
    -   ***Growable Stage 11 CO§§ providing 6818 medium wealth jobs. (CAM)***
    -   Plopable static landmark.

    **The stats are as follows:**

    Ahh, I get sick of typing them out every time. It's all in the readme, and they've been made with the SC4PIM, so it's all good.

    **Dependencies:**

    These are the files you need for these lots to be able to function in the game…

    • None today.

    **Installation:**

    Copy the HKBAT folder into the Plugins folder.

    If you want to use the CAM version, you must also copy the CAM folder.

    -   CO$$8\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Growable CO§§*
    -   PLOP\_CO$$\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Plopable CO§§*
    -   CO$$11\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot = *Growable CO§§ (**CAM**)*
    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Landmark*

    The package includes the following landmark variants:

    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza-No Screen.SC4Lot
    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza-Kim Jong Il.SC4Lot
    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza-Heineken.SC4Lot
    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza-Geisha.SC4Lot
    -   PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza-Coca Cola.SC4Lot

    We recommend installing only one variant, or you can install all variants and let the game decide which one to use.
