    **Aurora Plaza**

    *Model, Modding / Lotting, Custom Menu Icons & Readme – Cockatoo.*

    **Overview:**  Aurora Plaza is a big shiny tower in Shanghai. In real life, at night, it features a 15 story high video screen on its front facade, but because not *everybody* wants to see a giant depiction of a puppet Kim Jong Il in their cities, I’ve included two versions of the model. The no screen version features brighter orange night-lighting (which I think looks better) while the screen version has dimmer green lighting and of course, the giant video screen, similar to that of the real building.

    In this download there are three versions included:

    • Growable Stage 8 CO§§ providing 3355 medium wealth jobs.

    • Plopable functional CO§§ providing 3355 medium wealth jobs.

    • Plopable static landmark.

    **The stats are as follows:**

    Ahh, I get sick of typing them out every time. It's all in the readme, and they've been made with the SC4PIM, so it's all good.

    **Dependencies:**

    These are the files you need for these lots to be able to function in the game…

    • None today.

    **Installation:**

    If you don’t want to see Kim Jong Il in your cities at night, extract Aurora Plaza-No Screen.SC4Model and your choices of any of the three versions above into your C: MyDoccuments/SimCity4/Plugins folder.

    If you value realism above all else, extract Aurora Plaza-Screen.SC4Model and your choices of any of the three versions above into your C: MyDoccuments/SimCity4/Plugins folder.

    You can only use one at a time.

    If you don’t read this and just extract both into your plugins folder, you’ll default to the screen version in game.

    • CO$$8\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Growable CO§§*

    • PLOP\_CO$$\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Plopable CO§§*

    • PLOP\_4x4\_Aurora Plaza.SC4Lot  =  *Landmark*
