    **The United Nations Project Presents…**

    **The Secretariat Building**

    **Model: Cockatoo, Jasoncw and SimFox | Modding: Cockatoo**

    **Lot Design: T Wrecks**

    **Overview:**

    A few people commented that they would like to be able to use the Secretariat Building in their cities without the entire UN complex. Now you can!

    **Versions Available:**

    We’ve made available a Dark truNite model for day/night mod users in addition to a regular Maxis truNite model for those who don’t.

    There are also three different lot files that can be installed. They are listed below.

    -   A growable stage 8 CO§§ providing 3877 medium wealth jobs.
    -   A plopable functional CO§§ providing 3877 medium wealth jobs.
    -   A plopable static landmark.

    For those who use Submenu DLL, you will find the Landmark version in the dedicated submenu for the United Nations.

    **The stats are as follows:**

    See the readme file.

    **Dependencies:**

    These are the files you need for these lots to be able to function in the game…
