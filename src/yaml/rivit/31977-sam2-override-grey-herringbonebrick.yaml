  summary: RVT SAM2 Grey Herringbone Brick
  description: |-
    This is an algorithmic recoloring of the Red Herringbone Brick, which may be better used in European Style cities with a lot of W2W (or somewhere it rains or snows a lot in general) where clinker or dark brick is often used in roadways.

    You cannot have Grey and Red together as there is only one SAM2 slot to override.

    Revert by removing. Roads will go back to NAM Red SAM2 look.

    These are designed to work seamlessly with all of my Streets. Also goes well with MGB's SAM7 and a white wine.

    Produced with Photoshop, GoFSH and Reader.
    
    v1,v2: never publicly released

    Oct 2017
    v3: regeneration of all textures according to NAM36 standard
      WRC curves now included
