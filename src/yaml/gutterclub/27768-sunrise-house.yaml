  summary: Sunrise House
  description: |-
    I present the fictional Sunrise House, esentially 2 W2W buidlings crammed in together utilising that ever decreasing space in most modern cities.

    It comes as a growable CO$$ stage 7 on a 1x2 lot with 250 jobs. If you want to plop it just use the building plop cheat and find it under sunrisehouse.

    There are x2 folders, 1 for Darknite and the other Maxis nite, please do not put both into your plugins, select the one required and remove the other.

    dependencies for Dark nite use; [https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
