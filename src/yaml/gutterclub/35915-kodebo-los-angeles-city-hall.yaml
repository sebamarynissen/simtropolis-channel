  summary: Kodebo - Los Angeles City Hall
  description: |-
    Former (although I really wish he would return to BATing) member Kodebo sent me the files for his incredible LA City Hall he worked on many years ago which has been sitting on my hard drive. Rather than let it gather electronic dust it would be better served being used by the community. Lotted as a basic Landmark feel feel to lot as you please. I have a few other incoming treats to share over the next few weeks.
