    Hello folks, here is the Tyler Street Garage. Yep another W2W quickie, this Bar and Cafe was formerly an old parking garage, converted into a shiny new Bar for your Sims to grab a beer and a bite to eat and perhaps have a drink on the rooftop terrace.

    Comes with both Darknite and Maxisnite, just select which one when downloading.

    It is a C$$ stage 5 growable with 20 jobs, if you wish to plop just use the extracheats.dll and look for 'tyler'

    dependencies for Darknite use: [https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
