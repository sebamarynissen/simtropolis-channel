  summary: Generic Repairs
  description: |-
    Generic Repairs are two small 1x1 garages for your City. I have lotted them as Parks as the real reason for their use is for W2W fillers as seen in the 3rd screen shot. I use them for when I need to extend a wall to wall building e,g if I have a 1x2 but need to fill a 3 squares deep lot. Feel free to re-lot them, use them for anything. Enjoy!
