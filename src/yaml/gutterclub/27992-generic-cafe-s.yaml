  summary: Generic Cafe's - Darknite
  description: |-
    Doing a bit of recycling, using the basis of my Cafe Nero BAT I've quickly knocked up a couple of W2W BATs, one which is a corner lot. Contained in this upload is.

    x2 models (normal and corner)

    x2 growable (plop with building plop cheat) CS$$ stage 3 lots with 10 jobs

    Unfortunately I have lost the Max files and only have the Darknite BATs otherwise I would have done both.

    Depedencies;
