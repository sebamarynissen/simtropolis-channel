  description: |-
    This is a take it or leave it BAT and the first thing I ever made before I knew anything. It is a W2W modern low to midrise based on a boring building in Auckland, indirect thanks go to Cockatoo for the great texture he posted in the forums. It comes as a 1x2 landmark and hopefully growable. Unfortunately it is not nightlighted as I did not know how to do so back then..

    As I say, take it or leave it BAT which I feel is better shared than just sitting on my hard drive.
