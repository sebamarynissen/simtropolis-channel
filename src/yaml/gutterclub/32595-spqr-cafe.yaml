  summary: SPQR Cafe
  description: |-
    Trying to clear off some BATs from my HD, I present the SPQR Cafe. A C$$ for 40 workers, his little wall to wall cafe is perfect for a sunny day, sitting on the sidewalk tables with your French Bulldog tied up under the table!

    Sorry, closed at night so no night lights!
