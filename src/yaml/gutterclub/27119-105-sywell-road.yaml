    Happy New Year!

    I present the fictional 105 Sywell Road, a low rise W2W you can find in most modern cities. This was a little quickie I threw together to fill that ever needed W2W space.

    It comes as a growable CO$$ stage 5 on a 1x2 lot with 121 jobs. If you want to plop it just use the building plop cheat and find it under 105sywell.
