  summary: Richies Electronics
  description: |-
    Another quckie inspired by a random Brooklyn street view wander. Here is Richie Electronics store, a CS$ stage 5 with 35 jobs on a 1x2 lot. Sits wall to wall on one side with a small parking lot on the right hand side.

    The mural is from one of my fave street artists and one of New Zealand's very own, Owen Dippie. He has done some amazing work but believe he is now living in New York and leaving gifts on walls across the City.

    Unfortunaltey no nite lights on this ine.
