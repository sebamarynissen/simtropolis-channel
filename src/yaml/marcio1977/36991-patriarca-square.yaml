  summary: Patriarca Square
  description: |-
    The Patriarca Square (Portuguese: Praça do Patriarca) is located in the historic center São Paulo, Brazil.

    At the beginning of the 20th century, the city began to develop plans to remodel and modernize the city in line with the interests of an elite who wanted to mirror the European cities. New buildings and new road works appeared, such as the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct and the Municipal Theater. Consequently, the Viaduto do Chá, built in 1892 to connect the "old" and "new" centers, was remodeled to increase the width of the alleyway and facilitate the circulation of streetcars and vehicles.

    At the beginning of the 2000s, there was a debate about restoring the square, which was dirty and neglected. In 2002, a controversial redesign completely transformed the site. As part of a series of initiatives promoted by the Viva o Centro Association to revitalize São Paulo's historic center, the project, which also included the Viaduto do Chá, led to the restoration of the square's original floor, the relocation of José Bonifácio's sculpture and the addition of a new roof for access to the Prestes Maia Gallery. The structure, designed by Paulo Mendes da Rocha, works as a portal to the square, framing the visual perspectives and open spaces. Since then, the square has maintained its new configuration, without any alterations, but to this day the new roof divides opinion as to its practicality and beauty.
