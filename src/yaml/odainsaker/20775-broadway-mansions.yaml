    BROADWAY MANSIONS

    Origin:  Shanghai, China.

    Broadway Mansions is a cubist Art Deco landmark completed in 1934 as an exclusive British residential hotel at the northern end of the foreign-controlled Shanghai International Settlement.  Located on the north bank of Suzhou Creek in the Hongkou District and connected to the famous Bund to the south by the Garden Bridge, the building takes its name from the area's principle street of Daming Lu, which was then known as Broadway Road, and upon which the building would boast Shanghai's first and East Asia's largest indoor parking garage.  Designed by Palmer & Turner Architects Limited, a prominent British firm working in Shanghai, the building would be the city's second highest as well as its tallest landmark along the waterfront, with terraces offering sweeping vistas of the surrounding city and bearing witness to Shanghai's oncoming tumultuous history.

    The Japanese in 1937 would seize control of the remaining Chinese sectors of the city after defeating the Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist forces in urban combat during the Battle of Shanghai.  Photographs taken from the terraces of Broadway Mansions would capture fearful scenes of panicked refugees fleeing the Bund across Garden Bridge as both the Japanese and Nationalists bombed and shelled what was once Asia's most glamorous city.  The British owners would sell the building to the Japanese that same year, and the commanding sightlines over the strategic Suzhou and Huangpu rivers would make the prominent building an ideal Japanese military police headquarters by 1941.  Suzhou Creek would become the dividing line between Japanese-occupied territory to the north in Hongkou, and the surrounded International Settlement to the south, with the steel Garden Bridge connecting the two foreign worlds at the foot of the Broadway Mansions.  Known as Waibaidu in Chinese, the picturesque Garden Bridge would become an infamous site of Chinese humilation, as Chinese attempting to cross the bridge were routinely stopped and punished by Japanese guards, while European travellers and their limousines were permitted across, with all this playing out before the starkly heavy profile of the looming building.  As Pearl Harbor was bombed, the Shanghai International Settlement was also finally invaded and its foreign residents themselves interned.  A striking pairing of early moderne design and engineering, both the Broadway Mansions and the Waibaidu are often photographed together.

    Shanghai would see liberation with the defeat of the Japanese followed only by civil war, with the Nationalist flag thrown down from the top of the Broadway Mansions as Mao Zedong's triumphant Communist forces secured victory in 1949.  Broadway Mansions would be renamed Shanghai Mansions, and as a new apartment hotel of the Party would become a favorite of Premier Zhou Enlai, who would show visiting dignitaries lofty vistas of Shanghai, the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party, from the Art Deco terraces of the former British bourgeois landmark.  However, years of devastating war and revolutionary upheaval had long scared away the return of the exiled foreign community and their investments.  With the reopening of modern China to the West under Deng Xiaoping, the seventy year-old building has restyled itself for foreign visitors as the 4-star Broadway Mansions Hotel, a 250-room vintage hotel appealing to affordable aspirations for Old Shanghai nostalgia.  From its aged terraces, particularly on the southern wings, today's guests can enjoy the flamboyant panorama of burgeoning New Shanghai, from the exuberant supertowers of the Pudong New Area and sweeping across the historic Bund and Old City into the dense urban spectacle of central Puxi.  A sign of Shanghai's cosmopolitanism, the hotel's five fashionable restaurants offer both Chinese Huaiyang, French, and even authentic Japanese cuisine, some set amidst period British decor.

    SimCity players wishing recreate the scenery of the Broadway Mansions may try facing the building LOT along a navigable canal or narrow urban river, and flank the building on one side with a short-span steel truss bridge.  Surrounding the building could be low-rise Asian-style dense commercial, low-rise European-style buildings, and even dense Asian-traditional structures with heavily tiled roofs.  In Shanghai today, highly-stylized modern towers rocket up behind the Broadway Mansions.

    Broadway Mansions BAT for SimCity comes in two flavors, New and Old:

    The New flavor shows the building in relatively recent configuration, with its most attractive signage using the Bayer company logo and the characters "bai er" phonetically used by Bayer for their name in China.  The most recent renovations have removed that giant sign along with the mast, but it was such an iconic and architecturally complementary sign that most photographs still highlight it.   Indeed, the building today somehow now seems to be missing something on top.  Recent renovations changed the current real world nightlighting to a uniformly overlit scheme suggesting Las Vegas, but the previous atmospheric red scheme is retained here as it is far more fitting of the architecture.

    The Old flavor is primarily based upon the building's prewar British configuration, with the protective 1930s-era canopies on its terraces, original topmost antennas in their Art Deco brackets, and minimized Chinese signage for players not explicitly recreating an Asian-themed city.  Some of the lighting, however, was drawn from the most recent renovation, as the blue light edge accents now employed around the tower and turrets work well.

    Players may use either flavor or even both simultaneously, and they have identical game stats and function as separate and self-contained BATs.

    Both BATs use the wonderful truNite technique developed by SimFox.  Maxis's awkwardly standard sunlit shadowing in the nighttime views have been eliminated, with the drawback that the brief morning and evening twilight views may look unusual.  Many thanks also to kd5rax for the "Poly Trees" models and wiz1989 for the "Bench And Chair Set" models.
