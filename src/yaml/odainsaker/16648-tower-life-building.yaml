    **TOWER LIFE BUILDING**

    Origin: San Antonio, Texas, USA.

    The crowning masterpiece of architects Ayers & Ayers. Completed in 1929 in restrained late-Gothic Revival style, its observation decks decorated with terra-cotta and festooned with gargoyles offer grand views of the city. Originally named the Smith-Young Tower after its developers, this was for over twenty years the tallest building in Texas and home to the city's top architects, lawyers, and insurers. Architects Ayers & Ayers would even claim a whole top floor with observation deck for 360 degree panoramic views of the city below. Intended as the initial centerpiece of a new downtown commercial center of landmark high-rises, the tower would never see its envisioned sister buildings completed, for the shocking onset of the Depression would crush further grand building projects. The building is currently named the Tower Life Building after its primary tenant, Tower Life Insurance. With its glittering wedding-cake crown gleaming in floodlights at night, this tower remains among the most popularly recognized and admired skyscrapers in San Antonio.

    I had hoped this could be a wall-to-wall or a diagonal lot, but the angles of the building base are just too bizarre. In exchange, I gave it a nice unpretentious plaza with an outdoor cafe.

    Let me know if there are any problems, as I do not have a city of sufficient size to test grow the growable version. Exemplar modding is another world for me, so who knows what I have really done. This model has been extremely long in coming, as I was planning it even BAT first came out, so I hope everyone enjoys it. A first BAT for me, hopefully there will eventually be more!

    Many thanks to everyone here and in the BAT Forums for their help, tutorials,and encouragement with this little project. I've downloaded gigabytes of great stuff from here, so it about time I gave something back. Enjoy!
