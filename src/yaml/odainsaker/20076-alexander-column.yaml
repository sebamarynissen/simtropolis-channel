    ALEXANDER COLUMN

    Origin:  Saint Petersburg, Russia.
    Created by Odainsaker.

    Monument unveiled in 1834 to honor Tsar Alexander I and his defeat of Napoleon.  Conceived by Carlo Rossi and designed by Auguste Ricard de Montferrand, it stands over 155 ft. and boasts a monolithic shaft carved from a single piece of pink Finnish granite, making this column the tallest such monument in the world.  The emplacement of the tsar's 600 ton monolith by 3,000 men working without modern cranes and machinery would prove an engineering feat worthy of the pharaohs and fitting for the Emperor and Tsar of All the Russias.  Centered in Palace Square before the tsar's Winter Palace, the angel holding a cross witnessed many pivotal moments of the Russian Revolution.

    The Alexander Column BAT comes with three included Lots.  The 3x3 lot has all the grandiose candelabra streetlamps and decorous iron fencing with the monument at the center.  The 2x2 lot has the paving somewhat truncated, but allows added flexibility in axial placement when the axial design of a player's SimCity centers along tile seams and even-numbered lot sizes rather than along a single line of tiles and odd-numbered lot sizes.  The 1x1 lot strips away all the streetlamps and iron fencing, but allows placement in the tightest of urban spaces.  This model was originally merely a test to see if I could successfully navigate the BAT4MAX, but, despite my novice unfamiliarity with the program, this tinker toy model grew into a full-fledge BAT complete with custom streetlamp props.  Though hardly perfect, making this BAT was instructive.  SimCity fans may feel especially free to refer to the charming streetlamp props as dependencies in their own uploaded creations, and many thanks to the authors of the STomnibus "Creating Custom Working Light Props" tutorial.
