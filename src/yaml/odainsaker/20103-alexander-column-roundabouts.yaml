    ALEXANDER COLUMN ROUNDABOUTS

    In my eager excitement finishing the original Alexander Column BAT a week ago, I forgot to include the planned set of NAM\-compatible roundabout fillers. My apologies, but I was too happy to have something seemingly done and cleared off the cluttered worktable, hehe. Here now are the roundabout fillers.

    You will still need to have the [previous download](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=20076) as a dependency, however, you do NOT need to redownload it if you have it already, and no files will be replaced or overwritten. This package merely adds several new lots and additional base models.

    THE COLUMN

    Origin: Saint Petersburg, Russia.
    Created by Odainsaker.

    Monument unveiled in 1834 to honor Tsar Alexander I and his defeat of Napoleon. Conceived by Carlo Rossi and designed by Auguste Ricard de Montferrand, it stands over 155 ft. and boasts a monolithic shaft carved from a single piece of pink Finnish granite, making this column the tallest such monument in the world. The emplacement of the tsar's 600 ton monolith by 3,000 men working without modern cranes and machinery would prove an engineering feat worthy of the pharaohs. Centered in Palace Square before the tsar's Winter Palace, the angel holding a cross witnessed many pivotal moments of the Russian Revolution.

    THE ROUNDABOUTS

    The Alexander Column Roundabouts set comes with three included Lots with overhanging props. Boasting the original decorative wrought iron fence and lofty candelabra streetlamps, the two 2x2 landmark lots are fitted for use as centerpieces with the Network Addon Mod (NAM) avenue roundabouts. One 2x2 lot has a raised dais with pale gold mosaic paving and a fancy border, with the other 2x2 lot has a raised dais with pale pink paving in classic spirograph pattern. The third lot is a 1x1 landmark lot without the streetlamps and is fitted for use as a centerpiece of the smaller one-way-road roundabouts. All three lots can be used both separately or simultaneously.
