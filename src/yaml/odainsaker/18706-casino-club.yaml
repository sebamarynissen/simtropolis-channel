    **CASINO CLUB**

    Origin:  San Antonio, USA.
    Created by  Odainsaker.

    A fabulous Mayan Art Deco landmark completed in 1927.  Given the large German immigrant population of Central Texas, local German American businessmen and socialites formed the Casino Association in 1857 as a German cultural social club.  Invitations to the association's ballrooms, theater, and clubhouse became the high point of the city's exclusive social life.  Over time, the German-based Casino Association would meld with the literary San Antonio Club, and together as the San Antonio Casino Club they would rebuild their new charming headquarters on a tight triangular lot alongside the San Antonio River.  Exclusive immigrant social clubs have long faded from public life, and this building has changed owners and stood empty for years.  However, revitalization projects have refurbished the historically protected structure into a mixed-use luxury apartment and retail building of pricey restaurants, and its location along the historic heart of the bustling Riverwalk urban space ensures that this festive architectural gem will remain a popular San Antonio landmark.

    The odd angle of this building does not allow for the classic 45-degree diagonal BAT, however, as a compromise this BAT comes with a partially diagonal overhanging ploppable LOT, around which you can layout your favorite street or landscaping configurations.  The "pr\_Ympyratalo Filler" overhanging diagonal plaza filler pieces, which comes with the wonderful Ympyratalo BAT modeled by prepo and uploaded to the STEX by Bongoswimp for SYM Productions, are especially useful and convenient for this purpose.  These optional decorative pieces are not included here, and the LOTs will still function independantly without them.  The diagonal versions do come with an overhanging foundation prop, which allows the LOTs to be placed near cliffedges and waterfronts in a manner similar to the real building.

    Some glaring liberties taken with the real building when making the model.  In no way does the real building use nightlighting in the ostentatious manner shown on the BAT, however, such a theatrical architectural style really deserves an equally theatrical lighting scheme.  Another change was made to the loggia on the diagonal side, which over the years has been configured as sometimes opened and sometimes glass-enclosed, and which here is one bay shorter than reality to simplify fitting the building onto a LOT.  Furthermore, the original building cantilevered this loggia over the river, and current remodels extend it down and open the basement into a new riverwalk commercial level down below street level, but that adds far more complication to the LOT than my sanity currently allows.
