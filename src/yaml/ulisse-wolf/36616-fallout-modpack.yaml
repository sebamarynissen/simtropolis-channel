  summary: Fallout Modpack
  "description": "**Fallout Modpack**


    This modpack contains the entire set of props and functional batches that
    are inspired by the Fallout series


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near
    future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would
    complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical
    support for the pack.


    ### INSTALLATION:


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with
    the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using
    7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the
    installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is
    recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux,
    use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), and for macOS, use
    [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click
    to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no
    changes here will install everything). Then, click to the Location tab to
    set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My
    DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). After this, click over to the Install
    tab, and click \"Start installation\" to begin the installation procedure.
    When installation is complete, the tab pop up a message indicating it, after
    which you are safe to close the installer.


    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove
    any previous versions from your plugins.

    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a
    collective/master and separately all the individual cleanitol files and by
    using either the newer **[nos.17's SC4
    Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol\
    /)** or the older **[BSC
    Cleanitol](index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleani\
    tol)** tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these
    files.


    Bear in mind that this Collection contains Prop packs only available with
    this upload. Those prop packs can be used and referenced by other contents
    may not part of this collection as dependencies. If a 3rd party upload
    references one of the prop packs available in this Collection, you don't
    need to install everything, you can select and install only the referenced
    prop pack. All prop packs (and the lot packs as well) have individual
    cleanitol files (besides the Cleanitol\\_MASTER REMOVE
    LIST\\_Moonlight\\_Canals\\_Collection.txt) and they have Prop Catalogue
    index images as a help for lotters.
