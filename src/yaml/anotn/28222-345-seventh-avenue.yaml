  summary: 345 Seventh Avenue
  description: |-
    345 Seventh Avenue is a neo-classical highrise in the Garment District in Manhattan, New York. It rises 24 stories and 93.7m above ground and houses retail restaurants and commercial offices. It was designed by John H. Knubel and built in 1929. 345 Sevent Avenue comes in a CO$$ version as well as a IM version to stay true to the nature of this and similar buildings in the area. The Garment District has been a centre of fashion manufacturing and design since the early 1900s. The building stands wall-to-wall on a 2 by 2 tiles lot.
