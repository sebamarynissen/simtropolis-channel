  description: |-
    **Columbia Railway Station** is a fictional railway station, build in 30's Finnish funkis-style. I made this bat in December 2008, so it's quite old ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)

    Station has 2 rail connections with three platforms. Fourth rail is a pass-by only, which is very common in Finland. Due to its small size its perfect for suburban areas or to small towns. Because I made this in 2008, it was re-lotted recently by *Master Paeng* because originally this was designed on my laptop which has been dead for a year soon. Station still has some of it original lotting, platforms, electricity pylons and blue timetables are props from me.
