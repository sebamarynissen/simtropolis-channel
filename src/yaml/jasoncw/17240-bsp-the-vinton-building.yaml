  summary: BSP The Vinton Building
  description: |-
    The Vinton Building was named for Robert K. Vinton, grandson of the founder of one of Detroit's oldest building firms. Designed by Albert Kahn, the steel framed building was constructed in 1917 and features Italian Romanesque influences with elaborate terra cotta detailing on the upper levels. Early advertising boasted of high speed elevators and direct daylight in every office.

    In 2005, a group of entrepreneurs led by former Detroit Lion Robert Porcher purchased the building with plans for residential condominiums and commercial space. Renovations began shortly afterwards, assuring the building's continued livelihood.
