  summary: BSP 211 West Fort Street
  description: |-
    Completed in 1963, 211 West Fort Street was built as the headquarters of Detroit Bank & Trust, which is known today as Comerica Bank. It was renovated in the mid 90s, after Comerica moved to a larger building downtown. 211 West Fort Street is currently the 18th tallest building in the city of Detroit.

    Included is a 2x6 and 2x4 CO§§ growable, and a 2x6 ploppable and landmark.

    There is also a bonus 2x1 parking garage lot.  Please note that "Jasoncw - 211 West Fort Street.SC4Model" (included) is a dependency for the parking garage lot.
