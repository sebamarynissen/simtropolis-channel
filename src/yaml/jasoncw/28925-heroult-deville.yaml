    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
    4\. SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
