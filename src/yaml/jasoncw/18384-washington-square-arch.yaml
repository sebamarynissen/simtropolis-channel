  summary: Washington Square Arch
  description: |-
    In 1888, to celebrate the centennial of George Washington's presidential inauguration, a wooden and plaster arch was erected at Washington Square Park, in New York City. The temporary arch was so popular that in 1892, a permanent arch, made of marble, and designed by New York architect Standford White, was built. The two statues of President Washington were added to the North side of the arch in 1918.

    As seen in [Hanson784's New York City Journals blog](https://nycj.blogspot.com/)!
