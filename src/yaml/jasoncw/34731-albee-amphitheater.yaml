    Albee Amphitheater is a 2x2 park lot with a sunken reflecting pool and amphitheater style seating. The pool can be converted into a stage area for performances. Its stats are in between Maxis's medium and large plazas, and it can be found near the end of the parks menu.

    -   2x2 park lot.
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included. 
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/). 

    Installation Instructions:

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity4/Plugins.
    3.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you do not want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
