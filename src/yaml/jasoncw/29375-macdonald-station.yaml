  summary: MacDonald Station
  description: |-
    MacDonald Station is derived from my [Telus Plaza upload](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29036-telus-plaza/), and has been made into a separate lot for increased playability. In real life it's an office building, but I have made it into a police station. It's comparable in size to Maxis's Large Police Station, and so it is comparable in stats, although the radius has been increased.  
      
    • 3x3 police station.

      
    • MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.  
    • Dark Nite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=23089).

    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
    4\. SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
