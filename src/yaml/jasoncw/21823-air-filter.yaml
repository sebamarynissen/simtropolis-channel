  summary: Air Filter
  description: |-
    The Air Filter reduces air pollution by sucking air through a dense volume of special vegetation which captures particles found in the air.  Run off water is collected underneath the filter, and is used to water the vegetation, resulting in cleaner water as well.  
      
    This small lot has pollution reduction capabilities far above those of other parks and trees.  They're especially useful for reducing pollution cause by traffic, though they'll reduce air pollution wherever you put them (in between transit networks, mixed in with zones, mixed in with parks, etc.).  Its small size allows you to place the Air Filter nearly anywhere you need it.   
      
    Reduced pollution will increase desirability, and allow for larger and wealthier buildings, as well as high tech industry, resulting in more tax revenue.  
      
    However, the Air Filter is not a cheat lot.  The lots are cheap enough that you can use them throughout your city, but they are not so cheap that you can place them thoughtlessly without hurting your budget.  And while they can overcome pollution they can not overcome bad city planning.  
      
    The Air Filter is a 1x1 lot which can be found in your Parks and Recreation menu.  More information can be found below.
