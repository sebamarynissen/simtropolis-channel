  summary: Dreieck Park
  description: |-
    Dreieck Park is a triangular park, found near the end of the parks menu. The lot is a 3x3, with overhanging corners creating a park with sides that are 6 tiles long.

    Since the park this is based on does not have any artificial lighting, I have not rendered nitelites for this BAT, and so there are no separate MaxisNite and DarkNite versions.

    -   3x3 park lot, with 6x6 overhang.
    -   No nitelites.

    Installation Instructions:

    1.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity4/Plugins.
