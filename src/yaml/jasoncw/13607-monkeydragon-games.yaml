  summary: MonkeyDragon Games
  description: |-
    A café, bookstore, and game shop all in one!  Erika the barista will serve you wonderful coffee as you play anything from Poker to Dungeons and Dragons, read (and hopefully buy) a book, or simply meet with your friends.  Rich in quality, yet modest in price and atmosphere, let Monkey-Dragon games come to your town!

    The building stats have been tuned to blend as smoothly into default SC4 buildings as possible. However, if your city has a high CS$$$ demand and an abundance of 1x2 or 2x1 lots, you may notice the building growing frequently.  Please keep in mind that many of the Maxis CS$$$ buildings repeat just as often, and that no amount of tweaking can avoid this while still having reasonable stats.
