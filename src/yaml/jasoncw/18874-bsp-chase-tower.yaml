  summary: BSP Chase Tower
  description: |-
    Chase Tower was built in 1959, to be the headquarters for the National Bank of Detroit. The building has gone through a number of name changes, reflecting a series of mergers, and was christened with its most recent name in 2006. The most consistent name for the building is "The Cheesegrater", coined for its facade of alternating windows and marble panels. Detroit's first skyscraper, the Hammond Building, built in 1889, was demolished to make way for Chase Tower.

    Chase Tower is surrounded by several Detroit landmarks, including One Detroit Center, The Guardian Building, The Penobscot Building, and Campus Martius Park.

    There five lots included. CO§§§ and CO§§ growables, ploppables, and a landmark. They can be used at the same time without any conflicts. Ploppable and landmark versions will appear in your Landmarks Menu.
