  summary: Audubon Building Don Miguel
  description: |-
    Originally called the Shermerhorn Building, the Audubon Building was built in 1891 in Manhattan, and was designed by George Post in the Romanesque Revival style.  In 1989, the National Audubon Society purchased the building, and renovations were completed in 1992.

    The National Audubon Society renovated the building with the environment and their money in mind.  The building is an outstanding example, and a pioneer of green architecture.  The cost of the building (per square foot) is in the same range as similar non-green buildings in the neighborhood, and it uses 62% less energy than New York's building codes require.  This saves the Audubon Society 100,000 dollars a year.

    This BAT was made by both me and Don Miguel.  He started this building, and nearly finished it, and I completed it from where he left off.  Most of the work on this building was done by him.  Afterwards, lotting and modding was done by T Wrecks.

    Please read the readme for more information.
