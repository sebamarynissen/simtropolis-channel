  summary: BSP Music Hall
  description: |-
    Built in 1928, Music Hall was originally named the Wilson Theater, until 1946 when the Detroit Symphony made it its home for a short period and it was renamed. The exterior features a bold Mayan Art Deco styling, while the interior was designed with a more conservative Spanish Renaissance influence. Music Hall was designed by William Kapp.

    This is a joint project by nofunk and me. Originally started together in 2008, we're pleased to present Music Hall to you today.

    This is the Dark Nite version of the Music Hall, made for the darker night environment created by the [Day 'n' Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/stex/details.cfm?id=23089).

    Included is a CS§§§ growable and a CS§§§ ploppable. Both versions are on 2x3 lots. The growable grows in the New York tileset.
