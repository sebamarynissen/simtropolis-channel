  summary: Benjamin Pump
  description: |-
    With the city growing, the need for more water became evident.  To cope with demands, a new pump was built in Benjamin Park, providing not only water, but recreation, and a new neighborhood focal point as well.

    There is one lot included, and it's a 1x1 water pump.  It's smaller than the game's, and it also has a park effect.  The cost has been adjusted in consideration of these differences.

    Please read the readme for more information.
