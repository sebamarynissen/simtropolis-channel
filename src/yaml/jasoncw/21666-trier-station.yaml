  summary: Trier Station
  description: |-
    Trier Station is a modern subway & bus station with a high capacity to aid your heavily congested subway system.  The integrated bus station will help connect your transit systems and increase ridership.  If Trier Station is not connected to a subway line, it will act solely as a bus station.  
      
    There is one lot included, which can be found in your Miscellaneous Transportation menu.  The lot is a 6x3, and serves both subway and bus traffic (but does not include any parking).  The bus and subway share the same capacity.
