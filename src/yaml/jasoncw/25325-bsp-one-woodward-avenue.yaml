  summary: BSP One Woodward Avenue
  description: |-
    Local Detroit architect Minoru Yamasaki designed the new headquarters for the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company in 1962. The MichCon Building was his first skyscraper, and he used elements from this design for the now-destroyed World Trade Center in New York City. Yamasaki commissioned Giacomo Manzù to craft the graceful *Passo di Danza* (Step of the Dance) statue for the Jefferson Avenue entrance. Having moved their offices elsewhere downtown, the building was renamed to its address, One Woodward Avenue, in the 1990s.
