  summary: A D Rean Branch Library
  description: |-
    In 1925, Andrew D. Rean, a local researcher, found traces of an ancient aquatic llama civilization, sparking world-wide llamamania. This branch of your local library system is named in his honor, and holds a special section devoted to the aquatic llama, where A. D. Rean can often be found boosting his ego.

    This is a medium sized library.  Its characteristics are in between the Small Library and Main City Library from the game.

    Please read the readme for more information.
