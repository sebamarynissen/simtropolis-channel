  summary: M Maria Branch Library V2
  description: |-
    This is the second entry into my V2 series of BATs, where I improve upon old creations for re-release.  This includes a visual makeover, more accurate modding, and DarkNite versions.

    • 4x4 library lots.

    • A grassy park version and a separate paved plaza version.

    • An animated .gif comparing the original BAT with the two new V2 lots is below.

    • MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.  
    • DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=23089).

    • Does not require, conflict with, or overwrite the original version.  Removing the old version is preferable, but optional.

    • The original version can be found here: [M. Maria Branch Library (Original)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19761-m-maria-branch-library/)

    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
    3\. SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
