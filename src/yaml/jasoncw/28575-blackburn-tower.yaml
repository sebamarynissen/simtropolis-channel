  summary: Blackburn Tower
  description: |-
    Blackburn Tower is a large glass office building for the Houston and Euro tilesets. It comes as both a CO§§ and a CO§§§, although it's recommended to only use one version at a time.

    -   6x4 growable and ploppable lots.
    -   CO§§ and CO§§§ versions.  
         
    -   CAM versions included.  
         
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=23089).

    **Installation Instructions:**

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.
    3.  If you use the CAM, download the CAMeLots and use them instead of the normal growable lots. Ploppables are unaffected.
    4.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
