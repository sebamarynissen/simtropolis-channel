    **Special thanks to [@Tyberius06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/660284-tyberius06/) for fixing the immortal lot bug, and improving the lots' stats! If you're using the original version, it is recommended to demolish all instances of the lots in your cities, and replace them with the updated version. -Jasoncw, October 2024**
