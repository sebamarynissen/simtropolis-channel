  summary: Penobscot Building
  description: |-
    Upon completion in 1928, the [Penobscot Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Building) was the tallest building in the world outside of New York and Chicago. This art deco tower is the third, tallest, and most iconic building in the greater [Penobscot Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Block) office complex.

    It was designed by [Wirt Rowland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirt_C._Rowland) of [Smith, Hinchman & Grylls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmithGroupJJR), who designed the nearby [Guardian Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Building), built a year later.

    [Corrado Parducci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_Parducci), a local architectural scupltor, provided Native American themed ornament for the building which is named after the Penobscot Nation.

    I first started this BAT way back in 2006 (over 7 years ago!), and for various reasons I needed to restart it.  I worked on Penobscot Mk. II from 2007-2008. Once again, as I progressed through the building I ran into problems and had to restart. I quietly worked on Penobscot Mk. III from 2012 to the present, and not even including the previous attempts it's been by far the most hours I've put into a BAT. Enjoy!

    **Installation Instructions:**

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.
    3.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.

    If you're not interested in Christmas lights and would like to trim some MB from your Plugins folder, you can remove the Christmas .SC4Prop file without adverse effects.
