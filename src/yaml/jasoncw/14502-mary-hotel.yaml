  description: |-
    Mary Hotel has been expertly designed to give you the best trade-off between comfort and price. The rooms and the building's exterior have been beautifully crafted with relatively inexpensive materials to keep room prices down, and the hotel's excellent service staff perform their duties with that same intent. You can enjoy your stay at Mary Hotel while still having enough money left to enjoy the rest of the city.  
      
    Includes many versions. The parking lots of the ploppables are transit enabled for a street connection. Please read the readme for full details.
