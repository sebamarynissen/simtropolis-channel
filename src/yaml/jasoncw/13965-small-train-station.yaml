  summary: Small Train Station
  description: |-
    A small train station made to fit in small areas, or areas where you do not want to demolish the area for a larger station.  Placing rail stations can increase rail usage, increase pedestrian traffic, and lower road congestion.  Pedestrian traffic increases customers for commercial lots, and lower road congestions reduces air pollution which decreases local desirablitity.  
      
    Rail tracks and and train stations take up alot of space in your city; this lot will enable you to place stations in places previously not possible.  
      
    This train station contains elements from the Beaux Arts and Art Deco architecture styles.
