  description: |-
    Design Research was an innovative retail retail store founded in 1953. This building was the flagship store and headquarters, built in 1969, and characterized by its broad floor slabs and frameless glass.

    Design Research has been uploaded in celebration of the STEX's 100,000,000th download. My interview for the event can be read [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/omnibus/_/simtropolis-articles/interviews/stex-100000000-dls-interview-with-jasoncw-r272).

    • 2x1 growable and plopppable CS§§§ lots.

    • MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included.

    • DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
