  summary: Telus Plaza South
  description: |-
    Telus Plaza South is derived from my [Telus Plaza upload](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29036-telus-plaza/), and has been made into a separate lot for increased playability. It's the taller of the two towers, and grows in the Houston and Euro tilesets.  
      
    • 3x4 CO§§ lot.

    • CAM version included.

      
    • MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.  
    • Dark Nite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=23089).

    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins. 3. If you use the CAM, download the CAMeLots and use them instead of the normal growable lots.  Ploppables are unaffected.  
    4\. SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
