  summary: Central Police Station
  description: |-
    With increasing crime, and difficult economic times, the city found itself with the need to consolidate small police stations, and create a strong, unified, central police station. This Art Deco structure is the fulfillment of that need.

    There is one version included-a 4x2 police station lot. It is better than the Deluxe Police Station in about the same amount that the Deluxe Police Station is better than the Large Police Station. However, it also has a very large coverage radius, and its monthly cost has been increased to reflect that. It has no patrol cars because it has no parking lot, however, the [Patrol Car Lot](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=20031) is available to provide off-site parking.

    Read the readme for more details.
