  summary: BSP Grosse Pointe Public Library
  description: |-
    Built in 1953, the Central Branch of the Grosse Pointe Public Library system is a modest neighborhood library designed by Marcel Breuer. Local patron of the arts Dexter Ferry paid for the building, as well as the mobile by Alexander Calder and the tapestry by Wassily Kandinsky inside.
