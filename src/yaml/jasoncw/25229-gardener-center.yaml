  summary: Gardener Center
  description: |-
    This late modernist tower offers quality office space to the investment firms of SimNation. At Gardener Center, the broadness of the boss's executive desk is matched only by the broadness of his secretary's shoulder pads.

    Included are a 6x4 and 4x6 CO§§ growable, and a 6x4 CO§§ ploppable. All versions are corner lots.

    This is the Dark Nite version of the Gardener Building, made for the darker night environment created by the [Day 'n' Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/stex/details.cfm?id=23089).
