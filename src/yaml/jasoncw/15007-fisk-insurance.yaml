  description: |-
    Fisk Insurance can insure just about anything, but for a price, of course. And now they're expanding their business into smaller cities, with this smaller office building. Let Fisk Insurance come to your city to provide the services that your citizens demand.

    This is a smaller version of the Maxis Fisk Insurance.

    Several measures have been taken to prevent this lot from growing too much, but if it still grows too much, there are more stategies outlined in the readme, as well as more information about the lots in general.
