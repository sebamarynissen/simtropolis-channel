  summary: Air Filter (1x1 Round)
  description: |-
    The Air Filter cleans polluted air by sucking it through a dense volume of special vegetation which captures airborne particles.

    This small lot is fitted for NAM roundabouts, and has air pollution reduction capabilities far greater than other parks and trees.

    Air pollution is reduced by 250 over a 20 tile radius, which is more than a coal power plant. It costs ยง835 to plop, and ยง225 per month.

    Unfortunately, because of the way pollution works in the game, traffic pollution isn't affected.

    The air filter is not a cheat lot. While it can overcome air pollution (at a cost) it cannot overcome bad city planning.

    -   1x1 park lot.
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd).
