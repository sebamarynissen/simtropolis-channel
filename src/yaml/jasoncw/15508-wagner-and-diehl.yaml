  summary: Wagner and Diehl
  description: |-
    In 2005, Wagner & Diehl was formed to offer a complete package of services to land developers in Sim Nation. As the business grew, it became apparent that they needed more office space, and a landmark building of their own. This building is the result of that need. Wagner & Diehl occupy the 9th floor, while the rest of the building is rented out to other tenants.

    Please read the readme for more information.
