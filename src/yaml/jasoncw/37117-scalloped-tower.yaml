  description: |-
    Scalloped Tower is an office tower featuring a scalloped facade, and a scalloped potato sculpture at ground level.

    There's a stage 8 version for people who do not use the CAM, and a stage 10 version for people who do.

    -   4x4 growable CO§§§ lot for the Euro tileset.
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
    -   CAM version included.
    -   Custom planter prop ("Jasoncw - Scalloped Planter.SC4Prop") included.

    Installation Instructions:

    -   Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    -   Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity4/Plugins.
    -   If you use the CAM, replace the growable with the CAM version.
    -   "Metadata.yaml" is included for [sc4pac](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36700-sc4pac-mod-manager/), and does not need to go into your plugins folder.
