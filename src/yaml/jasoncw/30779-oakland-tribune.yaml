  summary: Oakland Tribune
  description: |-
    Tribune Tower was the home of the Oakland Tribune newspaper. It was built in 1906, and the tower was added in 1924 when the newspaper made the building its headquarters.

    On this day a decade ago I uploaded my [first BAT](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/13607-monkeydragon-games/) with my Jasoncw username. I'd like to thank everyone I've gotten to know over the years. ![*:party:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_39.gif ":party:")

    -   2x2 growable and ploppable CO§§§ lots.

    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
