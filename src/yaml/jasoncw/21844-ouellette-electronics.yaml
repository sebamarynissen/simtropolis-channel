  summary: Ouellette Electronics
  description: |-
    Ouellette Electronics focuses on the design and manufacture of cutting edge electronics, with its dedicated staff developing some of the world's most advanced products.  At Ouellette Electronics, even the janitorial staff have PhDs.  
      
    This large, dense, and urban industrial building begins to provide an alternative to Maxises I-HT districts, which are sprawling, provide few jobs, and are visually unattractive.  Ouellette Electronics provides nearly twice as many jobs as the largest Maxis I-HT lot.  
      
    An I-HT (High Tech Industrial/I§§§) growable and ploppable are included.   There is an extra set of lots which have double the number of jobs as the normal version (marked as "X2").  These are for use with industry multiplier modds, though any of these lots may be used in any games, and without any conflicts.
