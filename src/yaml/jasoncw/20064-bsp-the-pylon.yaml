  summary: BSP The Pylon
  description: |-
    Designed by Isamu Noguchi, The Pylon sits at the base of Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, and anchors the entrance to Hart Plaza, which he also designed with the same spirit of elemental simplicity. The Pylon was inspired by the double helix of DNA. Noguchi said, "All things tend to spiral- water and air. This is a basic thing. It is so basic it is beyond design. It's so basic, it is like a needle." It was built in 1973.

    There are two landmark lots included, a 1x1 and a 2x2, which allow you to align The Pylon to either roads or avenues, or to be placed in traffic circles. You can use any combination of these two lots without conflicts.

    **There are two versions of the .SC4Model file, but you can only install one of them.**

    Please read the readme for more information.

    **Files Included:**

    **Jasoncw -** **BSP** **- The Pylon (AA).SC4Model:** This version features anti-aliasing, resulting in smoother borders around the building. Features TruNite. This is the recommended .SC4Model file to install.

    **Jasoncw -** **BSP** **- The Pylon (NAA).SC4Model:** The anti-aliasing effect on the other version causes a visual glitch (gameplay is not affected) when the building overlaps certain objects in the game (for example, the Wind Power Plant). If you run into problems with the AA version, you can replace it with this one. Also features TruNite.
