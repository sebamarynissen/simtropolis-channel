  description: |-
    Wellington Place is an apartment building located in Chicago.

    If you don't have many 3 tile deep residential growable lots, this building might grow a lot. It grows on medium and high density residential zones, and it's part of the New York and Euro tilesets.

    -   2x3 growable R§§ lot.  
         
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Installation Instructions:**

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.
    3.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
