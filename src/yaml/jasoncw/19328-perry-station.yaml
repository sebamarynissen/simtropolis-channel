  summary: Perry Station
  description: |-
    Perry Station was built in 1931 as a modern replacement to the city's old train station. This Art Deco station has four platforms, retail space, and office space.

    There is one lot included, and it is a 7x4 passenger train station. This station does not include parking, so sims can not drive to it unless you place a parking garage nearby. This station does not load or unload freight; however, freight trains may pass through it.

    Please read the readme for more information.
