  summary: Continental Bank and Trust
  description: |-
    This is a recreation of 30 Broad Street, built as the headquarters for Continental Bank and Trust, in New York City. I've modified the building to adapt it to SimCity 4. This model is based on the building's original 1930s appearance.

    The lot is a 2x3 corner lot that grows in the New York 1940 tileset.

    -   2x3 growable and ploppable CO§§ lots.
    -   CAM version included.
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    Installation Instructions:

    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.
    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity4/Plugins.
    3.  If you use the CAM, download the CAMeLot and use it instead of the normal growable lot. Ploppables are unaffected.
