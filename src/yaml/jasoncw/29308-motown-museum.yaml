  summary: Motown Museum
  description: |-
    [Motown Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown) was founded by Berry Gordy, Jr. in 1959 in Detroit, Michigan. Gordy purchased 2648 West Grand Boulevard, where he boldly hung a sign “Hitsville U.S.A.” over the front door. Motown would be headquartered there for the next decade, absorbing adjoining buildings on both sides of the street, transforming it into a hits factory. [Hitsville U.S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitsville_USA) and an attached house were converted into the [Motown Museum](http://www.motownmuseum.org/) in 1985.

    With the slogan "The Sound of Young America", Motown Records was a powerful force of racial integration in the 1960s, making pop-infused R&B that was accessible to young people of all races. Kids jumped police-guarded barriers segregating concerts, venues which previously banned black artists began allowing them, and the Motown Sound permeated through all of American culture.
