#   summary: Patrol Car Lot
#   description: |-
#     There is an issue with this lot not being able to be bulldozed in some circumstances. Eventually I'll get around to fixing and updating it, but until then, use at your own risk. I apologize to those whose cities have been affected.  
      
      
#     Confronted with tight urban spaces, the police department decided to park its patrol cars off-site.  
      
#     This lot is designed to complement Police Kiosks, and the [Central Police Station](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=20030). It does not provide policing power, it only provides squad cars.
