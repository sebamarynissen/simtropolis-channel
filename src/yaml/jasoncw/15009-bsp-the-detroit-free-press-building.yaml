  summary: BSP  The Detroit Free Press Building
  description: |-
    The Detroit Free Press Building began publishing as the Democratic Free Press and Michigan Intelligencer on the morning of May 5, 1831. Michigans oldest daily newspaper, it supported the drive for statehood, helped establish the Associated Press, and sent reporters to the battlefield to cover the American Civil War. In 1853 the Free Press Began publishing the states first Sunday Newspaper. By its 150th year its staff had earned six Pulitzer Prizes.

    This model is based on the current building, located in downtown Detroit at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard. The building was designed by Albert Kahn and built in 1925. It was added to the states historical register in 1981.

    For SimCity 4, the building has been adapted in various versions to give you the widest possible choice, depending on your individual taste. Please read the readme for more information.
