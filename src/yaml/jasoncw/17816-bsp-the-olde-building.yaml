  summary: BSP The Olde Building
  description: |-
    The Olde Building was built in 1927. It is designed by Albert Kahn, with sculptural work by Corrado Parducci. The building sits across the street from the famous Lafayette and American Coney Islands, on the corner of Griswold Street and Lafayette Boulevard, in Detroit, Michigan. Its address is 751 Griswold Street.

    It once housed headquarters for Olde, which was bought by H&R Block, who then had offices in the building. Recently, H&R Block moved to the nearby Dime Building, and The Olde Building is currently being marketed as retail on the first two floors, and lofts above.

    This month, a member of the Detroit online community, Jeff Colby, died. While I didn't know him in real life, and I didn't know him very well online, he was very helpful on [the forums](http://detroityes.com) when I asked for help on Barry Sanders Project buildings. He's provided reference photos and histories for many of my Barry Sanders Project buildings.

    Please read the readme for more information.
