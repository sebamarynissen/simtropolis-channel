  summary: 220 West Congress
  description: |-
    220 West Congress is a nondescript office building located in downtown Detroit, Michigan. For the purposes of the game it's been modded as a CS§§ lot.

    220 West Congress has been uploaded in celebration of the STEX's 100,000,000th download. My interview for the event can be read [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/omnibus/_/simtropolis-articles/interviews/stex-100000000-dls-interview-with-jasoncw-r272).

    -   1x3 growable and plopppable CS§§ lots.  
         
    -   MaxisNite and DarkNite versions included.
    -   DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).  
         
    -   Requires [mipro Essentials - December 2013](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29130-mipro-essentials/) or newer.

    3.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
