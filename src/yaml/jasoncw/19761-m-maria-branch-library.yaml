  summary: M Maria Branch Library
  description: |-
    With existing facilities being dated, a new efficient and clean library of glass, steel, concrete, and marble was built.

    For the game this would be considered a large library, but for large cities in real life, a library of this size would probably not be the main library.

    Please read the readme for more information.
