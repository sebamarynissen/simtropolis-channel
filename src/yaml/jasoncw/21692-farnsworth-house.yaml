    The [Farnsworth House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnsworth_House), designed and constructed by [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe) between 1945-51, is a one-room weekend house located in rural Chicago. The steel and glass house was commissioned by Dr. Edith Farnsworth, a prominent Chicago-based nephrologist, as a place where she could enjoy nature and engage in her hobbies, playing the violin, translating poetry, and enjoying nature.

    The Farnsworth House is widely recognized as an iconic masterpiece of modernist architecture.

    There is a landmark version, and a growable high wealth residential version. Both are on 4x4 lots.
