  summary: Warwick Square
  description: |-
    This is a six lot set of Regency terraces located in the Pimlico neighborhood of London.

    • 6 growable 1x2 R§§§ lots.  
    • Four of the rowhouses are midblock lots (6-7, 9-10, 12-13, and 15-16 Warwick Square) and two of them are corner lots (22-23 Warwick Square, and a mirrored version, 22-23 M).   
    • Ploppable lots are not included because it is not possible to make functional residential ploppables for SimCity 4.

    • MaxisNite and DarkNite versions.   
    • DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Installation Instructions:**

    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
    3\. The included files are descriptively titled. Remove the .SC4Lot and corresponding .SC4Model file of what you don't want.
