  summary: Inland Steel Building
  description: |-
    The [Inland Steel Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Steel_Building) is a commercial skyscraper located in Chicago. It was designed by [SOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_%26_Merrill), and completed in 1957, making it the first skyscraper in the Chicago Loop after the Great Depression. By moving the structural columns to the building's perimeter, and by consolidating all other service functions in a separate tower, the the architects achieved completely column free office space with 360° panoramic views. It was designed as the headquarters of the [Inland Steel Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Steel_Company), and the building's stainless steel exterior was left unpainted.
