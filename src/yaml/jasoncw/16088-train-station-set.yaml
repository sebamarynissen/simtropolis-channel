  summary: Train Station Set
  description: |-
    This set contains 3 train stations: a small 1x2, a medium 1x4, and a large 2x4. The small and medium stations have already been released, however, these versions have improved textures, more efficient LODs, and improved lot designs. You can use all versions at the same time with no conflicts.

    The small size of these stations allows them to be placed in areas where most train stations don't fit, and they have the potential to increase ridership across your entire train network. Train stations can also increase pedestrain traffic, and decrease road congestionalong withit's associated air pollution.

    Please read the readme for more information.

    As previously stated, you can use the new versions of the train stations (found in this set) along with the old versions with no conflicts. The original small train station can be found [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=13965), and the original medium sized train station can be found [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=14067). They are not required for the new versions to work.
