  summary: Telus Plaza North
  description: |-
    Telus Plaza North is derived from my [Telus Plaza upload](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29036-telus-plaza/), and has been made into a separate lot for increased playability. It's the shorter of the two towers, and grows in the Houston and Euro tilesets.  
      
    • 3x4 CO§§ lot.

      
    • MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions included.  
    • Dark Nite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=23089).

    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.  
    2\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
    4\. SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
