  summary: Grand Haven Lighthouse
  description: |-
    A lighthouse has existed at the Port of Grand Haven since 1839. Since then the pier has been extended and lighthouses have been built and modified on it until it reached its current state in 1922. A catwalk makes the inner and entrance lights accessible during the Lake Michigan's dramatic storms. The lighthouse's distinctive long pier has made it a popular tourist destination on the west coast of Michigan. The [Grand Haven Lighthouse](http://www.ghlighthouse.com/) is located in Grand Haven, Michigan. 

    The great length of the pier has been accommodated as an overhang prop for your convenience. Plop it on a 1x1 piece of land, and the pier will overhang out to its full length.

    Grand Haven Lighthouse has been uploaded in celebration of the STEX's 100,000,000th download. My interview for the event can be read [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/omnibus/_/simtropolis-articles/interviews/stex-100000000-dls-interview-with-jasoncw-r272).
