  summary: Telus Park
  description: |-
    Telus Park is derived from my [Telus Plaza upload](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29036-telus-plaza/), and has been made into a separate lot for increased playability.  
      
    • 2x2 park lot.

      
    • The park has no nitelites, so there are not separate MaxisNite and DarkNite versions.  
    • Jasoncw - Telus Plaza.SC4Prop is the same file that is included in the original Telus Plaza upload. You may remove the duplicate in order to save space.

      
    **Installation Instructions:**  
      
    1\. Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.  
      
    **BAT and modding by Jasoncw**
