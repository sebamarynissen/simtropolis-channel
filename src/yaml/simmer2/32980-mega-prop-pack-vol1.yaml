    **SM2 Mega Prop Pack Vol1** is a compendium of 670 models I created over the years. It replaces many files and eliminates the need to have many dependencies.

    Please use the included cleanitol text file. It is very important to do so as to avoid redundant and unnecessary files taking up space in your plugin.

    Many lots are being updated to point to this file.  
    Besides the usage of the cleanitol files no further action is required.

    Thank you
