    Hello fellow SC4 player and thank you for downloading my lots.

    First a small premise.

    Hump yards are the largest and most effective classification yards, with the largest shunting capacity, often several thousand cars a day. The heart of these yards is the hump, a lead track on a small hill over which an engine pushes the cars. Single cars, or a block of coupled cars, are uncoupled just before or at the crest of the hump, and roll by gravity down a ramp and by the use of a braking system called "retarders" the cars are slowed down and directed onto their destination tracks with a complex computerized switching method where the cars are sorted, called the classification bowl. You will find more information here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification\_yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_yard)

    This lot is not for the faint of heart. It is massive, with a total tile length of 69 and a width at the widest point of 13 tiles.  
    Also this particular project is not your run of the mill freight yard, it is a fully fledged Hump Yard with all the trimmings and with a custom made RRW overlay and base texture set. I took every possible steps to ensure that almost all details of a real hump yard were replicated into this texture set, including the braking system (retarders) both the ones at the beginning and at the end of the hump yard and the oil stains on heavy usage areas.

    Most train cars are timed so as to simulate activity during the game day/night.  
    Power and water are not necessary however if you want to see the models and street lights in action I suggest you connect a power source to the lot. I modded Hump Yard 2 as a freight yard therefore you will see freight trains leave the hump yard. You will also see freight trucks bring the goods into the yard for shipping.

    There are 7 lots all together and they are the Base, Extension, Ramp, Main Yard 1, Main Yard 2, Main Yard 3 and Main Yard 4. I have made custom icons so they stand out on the rail interface lineup. I also made them easy to use by marking them in a logical manner. **I included a PDF tutorial with pictures and dependencies list to make things easy. If you follow the instructions within you will have perfect results!**

    Being a Hump Yard or Classification Yard we will have to do a bit of terra-forming in order to have perfect lot placement results.  
    Also in order to have perfect gradient slopes you will need Ennedi's medium slope mod in your plugin (you can always remove it once done terra-forming). You can get Ennedi's slope mods here [https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex\_filedesc.php?lotGET=1512](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1512) there are 3 mods in that pack you only need the medium installed.

    **Credits**  
    Many thanks go to **Bipin** for allowing me to include the gravel pile prop from his industry essential pack. To see more of his fantastic work please visit his page at

    I also want to thank **mgb204** for making the wonderful timed family prop file, also included.

    Last but not least, a big thank you goes to **Swordmaster** and **Indiana Joe** for planting the seed which grew into this great lot ensemble and for prodding me along the way.  
    I'm glad I was able to fulfill the dream that started as a concept many years ago.

    Everyone is welcome to use my textures to make new lots. I only ask that you link this download as a dependency and I would appreciate you mentioning my name if you upload your lot/s.
