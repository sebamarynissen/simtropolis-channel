    **SM2 Rail Service Yard 1.**

    Hello fellow player.

    This lot is one of 2 of a STR (Single Track Rail) set I have been wanting to release for a while.  
    So, I decided to make this lot a bit..uhmm animated. I achieve it by creating a few dozen timed props and some are in families.  
    Every time you plop this lot some of the train cars will change configurations, furthermore, the service rail line (the one nearest the gravel road) will display 2 different convoys.

    Between 5am and 1pm you get the tanker cars and the first shift repair crew.  
    One of the tanker blew the air brakes and you can see the crew making that repair.

    Between 2Pm and 4am you will get a convoy of train cars loaded with beets but one of the wagons has a very serious issue.  
    The left front axle bearing retainers broke apart shearing the massive bolts therefore a crane had to be called in to lift the wagon onto a flatbed truck and bring it to a better equipped repair facility (I think they will write it off).

    80% of the other train cars will appear and disappear according to preset times throughout the day in order to simulate activity

    It is fully rail transit enabled, just run the STR rail through it and watch both passenger and freight trains run across the lot.

    Custom texture included

    It requires power and water. It also provides 38 jobs.

    Open the zip and drop "SM2 Rail Service Yard 1" folder in your plugins and have fun.

    Many thanks go to **eggman121** and **mgb204** for teaching me how to code STR network.

    All of these dependencies are very common and I bet 99% of you already have them in your plugin.
