    **SM2 Danforth Train Station**

    A simple 1x6 Victorian era station modeled after one such I saw many years ago while traveling

    in Europe.

    Plop directly on the tracks or run a DTR line through it. I also decided not to allow freight

    trains to go through it therefore plan accordingly.

    This station also acts as a bus station thus there is no need to plop a bus station near it.

    Fully compatible with Maxis vanilla rail.

    Plop cost 7500

    Bulldoze cost 500

    Power req 10

    Water req 5

    Capacity 56000

    You will find it under the rail menu.
