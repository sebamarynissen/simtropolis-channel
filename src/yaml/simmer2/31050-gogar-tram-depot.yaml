  summary: Gogar Tram Depot
  description: |-
    We have a Freight Yard, a Hump Yard, an Intermodal Terminal and a Train Yard. Time to give our city trams a place to rest too no?  
    Therefore I present you with a modestly made tram depot called...**SM2 Gogar Tram Depot**!

    It is a close replica of the Edinburgh Gogar Tram Depot thus the LHD design. I hope there is someone here that has seen it in real  life and can attest to its likeness. What looks like "pink" gravel, used as the base, is actually crushed salmon colored bricks made from recycled construction material.

    I made many of the props you see in these pics and gave them all the necessary angles in order to mimic the real ones including an entire set of GLR catenaries with a total of 13 different angles.  
    You will also find many other props in the pack that reflect the same angles.

    Off course the base texture is totally custom made as well for the best possible effect.  
    I made the lot with TE in mind therefore you will see your tram automata run across the lot. Connect it to your GLR network and watch the trams run East/west and vice versa. There is also 2 entry/exits for visual road connections and one more GLR entry/exit that  will also connect visually.

    You will find it in the Miscellaneous   network   tab.

    $196 $$104 and $$$13 jobs are provided for any sims that wants to get off their lazy pixel bums and finally get to work.  
    Its an electricity hog therefore you will need at least 650Mwh to keep the lights on and 500 units of water per month to wash all those tram windows.....

    It will cost ya...  
    35,000 clams to plop it.  
    850 bananas per month for the lease.  
    And 1,500 silver pieces to bulldoze it.  
    Also, at 30x14 tiles it will need a sizeable chunk of real estate therefore plan ahead

    Big thanks to **mgb204** for making those wonderful depot buildings. (Robin I will exploit those depots till the end of time, lol).  
    Have fun and show it off on your next CJ.
