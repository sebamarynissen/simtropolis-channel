    **SM2 Trash Dumper**

    When garbage is sent to an incinerator, it usually gets there by rail if its too far.  
    This is such a facility.

    Garbage filled railcars are pushed on a ramp to a device that tips them in order to unload the trash.

    The Dumper is made with several instances of the model and then by timing them you get a sort of animation.

    The lot on itself is non functional and the RRW DTR rail will only connect visually therefore you should connect it to your main rail line by creating a spur.

    It looks great on its own or if you want to, you can plop it in conjunction with SM2 Trash and Burn for an even greater look. (refer to included pics)

    You will find it under the rail menu.

    Lot size 16X4Power used 50
