    **SM2 Kinetic Wave Energy**

    This is based on a real machine. Its actually being installed in many places around the world to complement wind powered turbines.

    It works by harnessing the awesome power of sea waves, a never ending source of kinetic energy. All green renewable energy.

    It plops entirely on water. This pack includes a special made buoy which will be needed to bring the power to shore. Turn on your power view and plop the buoy every 5 tiles. You will see the power being transferred by watching the green tiles light up.

    Use my power pack lots to simulate a transformer station on shore. Follow the instructions on that pack for bets visual results.

    Cost to plop 40000

    Power produced 6000

    Power buoy plop cost 10

    Life expectancy 100 years at full production.

    Find it under the power menu
