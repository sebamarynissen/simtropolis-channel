    SM2 Concrete Sound Barriers.  
      
    Its time for a new set of HD sound walls.  
      
    With 41 pieces at your disposal you can bet that just about any combination has been covered!  
    This set includes several FA3 (Fractional Angle 18.4 deg.) pieces for those special angled projects.  
      
    Orthogonal, 45 deg, FA3, exit doors, emergency phone, ortho to 45, ortho to FA3, end pieces, overhanging ones, 11 with graffiti plus a double length one and one special Orthogonal piece that you can plop on slopes of up to 45 deg.  
      
    To recap, 40 lots can only be places on fairly flat terrain and one flex piece for up to 45 degrees inclines.  
      
    I made them with no base or overlay textures therefore you can dress them with your favorite MMPs  
      
    ALL lots are neutral but one, the TEL piece. I made that one with nightlights.  
      
    Use them on your highways, roads, railways and they also look great as fences in between industries and residential.  
    I'm pretty sure you will find a home for them in your maps.  
      
    No Dependencies!  
      
    Just drop them in your plugins and play. You will find them in your park menu.  
      
    In the mix you will also find a single orthogonal EL (elevated) piece to be used with L2 highways. It is a prototype and I made with the Maxis L2 highway specs in mind. You can try with different highways to see if it works.  
      
    Have fun and post pics.
