  summary: SG SimTropolis Station DTR
  description: |-
    This is the DTR version of SM2 SG SimTropolis Station.

    DTR = Dual Track Rail. (RRW format)

    Same stats as the STR version. This one is clearly marked "SM2 SG SimTropolis Station DTR" in the transportation menu.

    **You must have the original SM2 SG SimTropolis Station and all the dependencies that are listed for that lot to avoid brown boxes and/or missing textures.**

    You will find the original lot and the complete set of dependencies here,

    Or here [https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex\_filedesc.php?lotGET=3378](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=3378)

    You can have both stations on the same city tile if you wish.

    Enjoy, Simmer2
