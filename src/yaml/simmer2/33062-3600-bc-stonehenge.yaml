  summary: 3600 BC Stonehenge
  description: |-
    **SM2 3600 BC Stonehenge**

    A model I made depicting how the original Stonehenge looked like thousands of years ago according to a map made by some archeologists.

    Place it anywhere you want and paint some MMP trees and rocks around it to fit your style.

    This lot has no base textures. Fully MMP compliant.

    You will find it in the Landmark menu

    Lot size 1x1 (3x3 overhanging)

    Plop cost 4000

    Bulldoze cost 100

    Monthly maintenance 100

    No power or water required.

    Dependencies....NONE!
