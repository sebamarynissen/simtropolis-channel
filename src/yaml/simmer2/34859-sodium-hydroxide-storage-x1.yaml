    **SM2 Sodium Hydroxide Storage X1**

    Due to the utter lack of decent 1x1 high wealth high tech lots I decided to do something about it and created my own.  
    I may expand this line of lots to cover more 1x1, 1x2, 1x3 etc.

    Now even if you industry grows along the high tech line you will finally have 1x1 I-HT (and more) lots to cover those pesky little 1x1 patches that always seem to linger.

    Stats

    Lot size 1X1

    Stage 3

    Power req 4

    Water req 3

    Bulldoze cost 326

    Provides I-HT$$$ 18 jobs

    It will grow on high density industrial zones.
