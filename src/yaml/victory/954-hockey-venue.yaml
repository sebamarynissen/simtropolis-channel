  description: |-
    It's Hockey Night in SimCity! The Polar Bears Minor League Hockey Club now has its own venue. They even brought their live polar bear mascot with them from the great white north.

    This Hockey Venue is built on 4x4 blank rewards lot and brings with it all the properties of a minor league stadium in a-lot less space! Look for it in the rewards menu.

    Thanks to biftek for the inspiration.

    Shoot that puck! Score that goal!

    UPDATE : Fixed the no-bulldoze problem

    **UPDATE: 30.07.2022 - Tyberius06: a reported Immortal LOT Syndrome bug was fixed and the updated contents reuploaded.**
