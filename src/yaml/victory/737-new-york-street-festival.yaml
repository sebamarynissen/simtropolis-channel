  summary: New York Street Festival
  description: |-
    The New York Street Festival is a common site through out the neighborhood during the warm summer and crisp autumn seasons. Your Sims can enjoy a tasty treat from the many ethnic cuisines offered or test their luck at any of the many games chance. Whatever they decide, they're sure to enjoy the feast on the street!

    The images show how the 3x2 lot will look when placed adjacent to and opposite one another forming a closed-off street. Of course you can use it any way possible.

    It was built on a concrete open space lot and cost 5s a month to maintain.

    Enjoy!
