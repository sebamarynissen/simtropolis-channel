    The Grand Tunis Landmark Hotel

    Rated 5 stars for the ultimate in luxury, the Grand Tunis brings the flavor of the North African Roman Empire to SimCity. Enjoy a Latte under the palms in the outdoor Atrium or dance the night away in Bogart's American Cafe.

    My first try at attempting to modify real architecture. All I can say is its a good thing I am on vacation.

    Check out my other lots, have fun and thanks in advance for your comments!
