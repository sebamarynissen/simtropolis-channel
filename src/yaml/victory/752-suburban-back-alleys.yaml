  summary: Suburban Back Alleys
  description: |-
    A series of 7 1x1 lots that can be used individually or grouped to form a suburban back alley. The lots contain garages and other items usually found in back alleys.

    The images shown are an example of how they will look when the lots are placed to form a back alley on a residential block. These lots will not grow.

    Look in the parks menu to plop them.

    40s to plop and Zero to maintain.

    Enjoy!
