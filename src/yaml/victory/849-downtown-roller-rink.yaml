  summary: Downtown Roller Rink
  description: |-
    Your Sims will line-up outside the Downtown Roller Rink. The rink brings your Sims all the benefits of a skate park while blending visually into and boosting desirability of the downtown commercial environment.

    Same cost to build and maintain as a skate park but with added Landmark Effect for increasing Commercial Desirability.

    Enjoy
