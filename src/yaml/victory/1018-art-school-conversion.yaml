  summary: Art School Conversion
  description: |-
    It seems those avant garde artist folk in SimCity are at it again. They just converted an old factory building into an art school and gallery. They're also serving delicious Latte' in the sidewalk cafe'.

    This lot functions exactly like a museum.

    Designed to blend into an industrial environment.

    Budget bug causing cities to go bankrupt fixed in v1.5

    Enjoy!
