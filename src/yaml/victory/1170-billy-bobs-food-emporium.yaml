  summary: Billy Bobs Food Emporium
  description: |-
    When the old Progen plant closed Billy Bob jumped at the chance to open his Food Emporium and Hydroponic Farm. Thanks to Billy Bob your Sims can now enjoy the health benefits of eating those healthy hydroponically grown foods. Billy Bob knows an opportunity when he sees one!

    The Food Emporium adds the same Health Effect (HQ) to an area in which it is placed as a Hospital but with a smaller radius. The hydroponic farm also uses a great deal of water so be prepared to boost your water supply if you are running near capacity.

    A functioning, tax paying, $$$ Commercial Service business that supplies 150+ jobs on a 5x5 lot.

    This may be my last lot for awhile as summer vacation is just about over and I will be getting back to my real life in the real world. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your praise and insight over the last month or so and especially thank all those great Modders and site administrators for making Simtropolis possible. It has been great fun!
