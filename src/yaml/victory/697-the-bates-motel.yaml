  summary: The Bates Motel
  description: |-
    Hitchcock comes to SimCity -There's a crowd gathering on the lonely road near the old Bates Motel, the home of Norman Bates and his mother. From the looks of things some foul play is afoot. Norman seems to be acting especially strange lately.

    Hitchock comes to SimCity in the form of the Bates Motel from the film"Psycho".
