  summary: Hobo Jungle
  description: |-
    Near the tracks, sheltered under the branches, is the Hobo Jungle, the home of the American railriding Worker of the early 20th century. Here you'll find the SimHobo waiting to hop the next freight train in search of an honest days work for an honest days pay.

    Put it next to railroad tracks, deep in the woods, and experience the romance of hobo history.

    Built on a 2x2 Plaza lot.
