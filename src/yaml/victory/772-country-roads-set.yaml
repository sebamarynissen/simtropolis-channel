  summary: Country Roads Set
  description: |-
    Your Sims can now travel off the beaten path down non-functional tree lined country lanes. This set of lots contains everything you need to cut a dirt road across the largest cornfield. Adds a bit of visual realism to the SimCity agricultural landscape.

    3 lots:

    2x1 Dirt road and wall

    3x1 Dirt road and wall

    3x1 Dirt road and wall intersection

    NOTE: These roads do not function as roads (built on open grass area lot) so do not expect them to grow into regular roads or effect traffic flow.

    Plop cost of 40s and no monthly maintenance.

    Enjoy
