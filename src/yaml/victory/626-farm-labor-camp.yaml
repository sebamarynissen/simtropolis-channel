  summary: Farm Labor Camp
  description: |-
    A "Grapes of Wrath" depression era farm labor camp (circa 1939) for your Sims who are fleeing the dust bowl. Very eerie place at night. Watch and listen quietly. Look for the water tower icon in the parks list.

    The design is based on a real depression era farm labor camp found at the following web page: [http://gallery.unl.edu/picinfo/13260.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20100628175424/http://gallery.unl.edu/picinfo/13260.html)

    My third lot. I hope you enjoy it!
