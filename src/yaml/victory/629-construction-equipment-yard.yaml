  summary: Construction Equipment Yard
  description: |-
    Someone is getting rich in SimCity building all those roads and skyscrapers. The Buildright Construction Co. is happy to take the rap. The yard is where all that equipment goes at the end of the day.

    This was done on a landmark blank lot and 5x5 squares. Cost 125S to place and no mm.
