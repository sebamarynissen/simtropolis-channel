  summary: Crop Duster and Farm
  description: |-
    SimFarmers can now keep their crops free of all those sim pests and assure the SimPublic's getting the finest in chemically treated fruits and veggies.

    Contains dirt airstrip, working airplanes, farm house, barn, and other out-buildings.

    This was done on a landmark blank lot and 8x18 squares.

    It looks best when placed next to similar corresponding farm terrain (crops).
