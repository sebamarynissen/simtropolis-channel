  summary: Yat Chau International Plaza
  description: |-
    Yat Chau International Plaza (street address 118 Connaught Road West), completed in 1994, is a postmodern skyscraper located in central Hong Kong. This version sits on a corner 4x3 lot and comes in CO$$ (3720 jobs) and CO$$$(2603 jobs) varieties. Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided, of which only one should be used at a time. The Darknite version requires Simfox's [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    Special thanks to [@Barroco Hispano](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/415633-barroco-hispano/) who made the beautiful cars in the parking ramp!
