    Exactly one year after my first upload, I present to you something new. ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)

    Nelson Hall is an ugly little 2x4 remnant of the 60s that I have modded in three different ways: a CO$$ growable, a CO$$ ploppable, and a college. The building and its [taller counterpart](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28836-keillor-tower/) are both named for famous Minnesotans, in this case Prince Rogers Nelson (better known as just Prince).

    Night scenes come in both Maxisnite and Darknite varieties. The Darknite scene requires Simfox's mod available [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/). Download and install only one of the two varieties (labeled DN for Darknite and MN for Maxisnite) at a time.

    Enjoy!
