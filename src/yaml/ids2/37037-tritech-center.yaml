  description: |-
    Built in 1982, it's a nice filler building, so it has that going for it. I messed with the scaling a little bit to make it a W2W, so it's a bit slimmer than its RL counterpart. Fun fact: it's located immediately next door to [another BAT of mine](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33139-minneapolis-public-service-center/).

    This is a 4x1 W2W building that comes in growable and ploppable CO$$ varieties, both of which provide 544 jobs.

    Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided. Only one may be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [SimFox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Dependencies**: None

    Enjoy!
