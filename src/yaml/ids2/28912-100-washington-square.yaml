  summary: 100 Washington Square
  description: |-
    ATTENTION: If you have downloaded this file AND my Nelson Tower file before 2014, you may have noticed a glitch in which the wrong building shows up on the lot. This was caused due to a shared building ID between the two buildings and can be remedied by downloading the new Nelson Tower [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28835-nelson-tower/). 

    100 Washington Square is a 332-foot (101m) tower in Downtown Minneapolis, MN. It was designed by Minoru Yamasaki (of WTC fame) and completed in 1981.

    This SC4 version sits on a 2x4 lot and has 3410 CO$$ jobs. Both growable and ploppable lots are included. 

    Night scenes come in both Maxisnite and Darknite varieties. The Darknite scene requires Simfox's mod available [here.](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) Download and install only one of the two varieties at a time. 

    The CAM lots included in this upload require the [Colossus Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30956-colossus-addon-mod/).

    Enjoy! 

    UPDATE 7-2-19: Added an additional non-CAM growable lot. Thanks to [@Tyberius06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/660284-tyberius06/) for pointing this out! ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)")
