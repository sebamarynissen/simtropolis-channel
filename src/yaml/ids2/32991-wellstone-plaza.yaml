  description: |-
    Wellstone Plaza is a 44-story office building for the Houston and Euro tilesets. It is a generic 1970s international style office tower based on a number of buildings I saw on a recent trip to Chicago, most notably CNA Center and Daley Center. I've always thought the rusty COR-TEN steel facades of buildings like Daley Center or the US Steel Tower in Pittsburgh were interesting, so this is my attempt at something similar.

    This model is available as a CO$$ tower in both growable and ploppable versions. It sits on a 5x3 lot and has 6000 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided - use only one at a time!

    Dependencies:

    [BSC\_TexturePack\_Cycledogg\_V 01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15322-bsc-texture-pack-cycledogg-v01/) - for my barebones lotting job

    [SimFox Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) - for the Darknite version of the model

    The CAM lots included in this upload require the [Colossus Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30956-colossus-addon-mod/).

    UPDATE 7-2-19: Added an additional non-CAM growable lot. Thanks to [@Tyberius06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/660284-tyberius06/) for pointing this out! ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)")
