  summary: 701 Building
  description: |-
    Designed by the late Helmut Jahn and completed in 1984, this 20-ish story postmodern tower is tucked away among the government buildings of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've always thought this building had the perfect size and form to be the defining building of a mid-sized city's skyline, but its unfortunate location in real life means that it's difficult to see from most angles, forever overshadowed by its much taller neighbors.

    This building sits on a 4x4 lot and comes in growable and ploppable CO$$ varieties, both of which provide 2476 jobs.

    Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided. Only one may be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [SimFox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Dependencies**:

    [BSC Common Dependencies Pack](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack) (specifically BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01, and BSC TexturePack Cycledogg V01)

    Enjoy!
