  summary: Highland Park Water Tower
  description: |-
    The Highland Park Water Tower is located in the Highland Park neighborhood of St. Paul, Minnesota. Completed in 1928, the tower stands around 130 feet tall. The tower no longer holds water, but still stands as a prominent neighborhood landmark.

    This version sits on a 1x1 lot and provides 10,000 cu. m of water per month. As always, both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided, and you can only use one at a time.
