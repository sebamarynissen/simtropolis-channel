  summary: Paramount Theater
  description: |-
    Built in 1931, the Paramount Theater is an art deco landmark in the city of Bristol, Tennessee. The building is located on State Street, which runs along the Tennessee-Virginia border and splits the town of Bristol in two. If you're curious about the history of the theater, [I've got you covered](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2670).

    I initially intended this to be part of the retro theaters pack I released last year, but I removed it at the last minute because it didn't quite fit with the others. After spending some more time on it, I think it's finally ready. I even learned how to make custom lot icons for the ploppable version - no more sifting through a sea of zoomed-out lot editor screenshots with ugly gray/black backgrounds!

    This is a 1x3 CS$$ lot that is available in both growable and ploppable versions. Both versions provide 41 jobs (as do my other theaters) and can be used in a W2W setting.

    As always, I've included both darknite and maxisnite versions. The darknite scene requires [this spiffy mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) by Simfox. Use only one at a time. Otherwise, no dependencies.

    Special thanks to the illustrious Jasoncw, who saved the day by exporting the LODs when I ran into an ID conflict issue.
