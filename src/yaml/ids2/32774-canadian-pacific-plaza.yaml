  summary: Canadian Pacific Plaza
  description: |-
    Situated at the intersection of 6th Street South and 2nd Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, Canadian Pacific Plaza is an international style skyscraper that was completed in 1960. Formerly known as One Financial Plaza and the First National Bank Tower, the building took on its current name in 2012.

    This model is available as a CO$$$ tower in both growable and ploppable versions. It sits on a 5x4 lot and has 1750 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided - use only one at a time!

    Dependencies:

    [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01 (v1.0)](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180) - for my tolerable lotting job

    [SimFox Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) - for the Darknite version of the model

    For more information about the history of this building, check out [this neat profile](http://www.lileks.com/mpls/firstnat/index.html) by James Lileks, a local writer and curator of ephemera whose website has aided me tremendously in this recreation.
