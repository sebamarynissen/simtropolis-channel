  summary: Retro Theaters Pack
  description: |-
    Awwwww yeah. Just look at 'em.

    I developed a brief infatuation with 40s-50s theaters a while back after driving past the real world Watts Theater of this pack, and I proceeded to model quite a few of them. This pack contains 4 of the best from that group. I tried to be as faithful to the originals as I could while still making them useful for SC4.

    Included:

    [Eureka Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/9062) - Batesville, MS (third screenshot)

    [Normal Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1699) - Normal, IL (fourth screenshot)

    [North Bend Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/11432) - North Bend, WA (fifth screenshot)

    [Watts Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3139) - Osage, IA (sixth screenshot)

    All lots are 1x3, CS$$, and are both growable and ploppable.

    Night scenes are provided in both Darknite and Maxisnite varieties. The darknite scene requires Simfox's mod available [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/). Download and install only one of the two varieties at a time. I mean it, only one. You can't have it all, so just come to grips with that now.

    Here's hoping you enjoy these. Please leave feedback below! Thank you all for your support.
