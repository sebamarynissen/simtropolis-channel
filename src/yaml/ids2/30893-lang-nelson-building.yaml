  summary: Lang-Nelson Building
  description: |-
    Back to Minnesota we go!

    This is a semi-recreation of the Lang-Nelson Building (at least, that's what the sign says) in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The building is planted on a 2x2 CO$$ lot that is available in both growable and ploppable versions. It should compete nicely with the Maxis buildings of the same size, but if you discover it growing like a weed, let me know and I'll nerf the job count (currently 154).

    As always, I've included both darknite and maxisnite versions. The darknite scene requires [this dandy mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) by Simfox. Use only one at a time. Otherwise, no dependencies.

    Special thanks to the venerable Jasoncw, who saved the day by exporting the LODs when I ran into an ID conflict issue.
