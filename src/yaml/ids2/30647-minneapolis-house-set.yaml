  summary: Minneapolis House Set
  description: |-
    Well, it only took me three years.

    I created the first house model back in August of 2012. I was pretty good at avoiding making any progress on these for a while, but I finally got the urge to actually finish them over spring break a couple months back. Today, I present to you 8 house designs with 4 color variations each for a total of 32 unique houses. Additionally, I have modeled a small set of 9 detached garages to supplement the houses in a manner similar to what you might see in real life. However, for those of you who prefer the default Maxis garages, I am including a separate version that does not contain the ones I modeled.

    Also, for anyone who would like to use the garages (or the houses, of course) in your own lots, you hereby have my permission!

    These houses are all based on real world counterparts in the Morris Park neighborhood of South Minneapolis. To anyone who lives there: I apologize for spending hours on end looking at your house on Google Maps. It's only weird if you make it weird.

    The brilliant SimCoug has graciously lotted and modded a wide variety of lots of various sizes for this upload, which uses the following dependencies:

    [JMyers Homes Vol 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2822) ('Props' and 'Textures' folders only)  
    [BSC Textures Pack CycleDog Vol 1](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=101)  
    [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)  
    [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol02](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2790)  
    [BSC MEGA Props SG Vol01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=746)  
    [KrashSpeed's Mailbox Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28412-krashspeeds-mailbox-set/)

    wmp\_fence\_props03.dat  
    and  
    wmp\_garden\_props02.dat

    Included inside:  
    **[WMP Mega Props vol. 01 - Misc General Props](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33621-wmp-mega-props-vol-01-misc-general-props/)**

    And, as always, the Darknite version requires this bad boy ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/\)) for the dankest of dank nightviews.

    Huge thanks to SimCoug for his magnificent work on these!

    For the curious, the number of lots broken down by size:

    2x3 - 2 (growth stage 1)

    3x2 - 2 (growth stage 1)

    2x2 - 4 (growth stage 2)

    1x3 - 5 (growth stage 3)

    1x2 - 5 (growth stage 4)

    2x1 - 2 (growth stage 4)

    1x1 - 5 (growth stage 5)

    25 lots total, all of which grow on the Houston Tile set and have the same stats as R$$ standard Houston homes.

    Special thanks to our Dirktator for his patience with me while I experienced issues uploading! I'd also like to give a shoutout to the community at large for your continued support. I've been on this site for over 10 years now (which seems absolutely insane) and I've seen a lot of faces come and go, but the community as a whole is just as helpful and welcoming as it always has been.

    Enjoy! Or don't, I suppose, as long as you give me feedback.

    **CB Edit:** Added WMP dep link. Thanks again to [@Garlicked](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/788118-garlicked/) for reporting.
