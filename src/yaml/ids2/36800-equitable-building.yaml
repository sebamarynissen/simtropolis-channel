  summary: Equitable Building
  description: |-
    Completed in 1968, the Equitable Building (now known by its address of 100 Peachtree Street) is a 32-story building located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Designed by everyone's favorite architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, this absolute stunner of a building broke all the rules, and immediately cemented SOM's reputation as the most innovative architecture firm in history.

    I first modeled this building back in 2012, not long after I first starting BATting, specifically because I was lazy and its boxy shape looked easy to model (hey, come on, I was in high school). After languishing on my hard drive for the better part of 12 years, I thought it would be nice to finally do it justice, so I remodeled it from scratch last year. At long last, I now present to you a mostly accurate replica, which is sure to be the most daring building in your skylines.

    This building sits on a 4x3 lot and comes in growable and ploppable CO$$ varieties, both of which provide 5891 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided, of which only one should be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [Simfox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Dependencies**

    [BSC Common Dependencies Pack](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack) - for the lot (specifically BSC Texture Pack Cycledogg V01).

    [Colossus Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30956-colossus-addon-mod/) - for the optional CAM lot.

    Enjoy!
