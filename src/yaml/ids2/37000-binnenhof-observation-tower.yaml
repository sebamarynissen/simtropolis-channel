  summary: Binnenhof Observation Tower
  description: |-
    As part of the ongoing renovations of the Binnenhof complex in The Hague, Netherlands, this temporary observation tower was constructed to allow visitors a view of the proceedings.

    1x1 lot, modded as a park, and that's about it. As always, both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided. Only one may be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [SimFox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Dependencies**: None

    Enjoy!
