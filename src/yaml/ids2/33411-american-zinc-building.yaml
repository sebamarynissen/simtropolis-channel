  summary: American Zinc Building
  description: |-
    Designed by Gyo Obata of Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum (HOK) Architects, the American Zinc Building was built in 1967 and is located in St. Louis, Missouri. After coming close to being demolished some years back, the building and its two neighbors were purchased and renovated by Drury Hotels.

    This building is a stage 5 CS$$ (both growable and ploppable versions are included) with 160 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided; only one should be used at a time, and the Darknite version requires [this mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) by Simfox (or another nighttime darkening mod). Otherwise, this lot requires no dependencies.

    Enjoy!
