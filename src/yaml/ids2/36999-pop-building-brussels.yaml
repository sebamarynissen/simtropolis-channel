  summary: POP Building, Brussels
  description: |-
    I found a picture of this building on a website aptly named "admirable facades," dedicated to documenting the most admirable facades in Brussels, Belgium. I thought this one, with its bright red geometric facade straight out of 1966, was pretty admirable.

    This version is a 2x1 W2W CO$$ building that provides 73 jobs. Both growable and ploppable varieties are included.

    Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided. Only one may be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [SimFox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    **Dependencies**:

    Enjoy!
