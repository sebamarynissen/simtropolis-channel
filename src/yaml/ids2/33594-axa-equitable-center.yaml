  summary: AXA Equitable Center
  description: |-
    Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the Axa Equitable Center is a postmodern skyscraper located at 787 7th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, NYC. The building stands 54 stories high and was completed in 1985.

    This model is available as a CO$$$ tower in both growable and ploppable versions, both of which sit on a 4x8 lot. Both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided - use only one at a time! Additionally, I have included a CAM version of the growable lot; if you have the CAM installed, simply swap out the normal growable lot files with the ones in the "CAM Lots" file.

    Dependencies:

    -   [SimFox Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) \- for the Darknite version of the model
    -   The CAM lots included in this upload require the [Colossus Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30956-colossus-addon-mod/).

    Otherwise, no dependencies are required.
