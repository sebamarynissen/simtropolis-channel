  summary: Greater Refuge Temple
  description: |-
    The Greater Refuge Temple is a church located on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd and W. 124th Street in Harlem, Manhattan, New York. The distinctive facade was added in 1966 and received a facelift in 2015. This model reflects the building as it currently sits after the renovation.

    This building is available in two versions: a ploppable CS$$ building with 30 jobs, and a reward building that is modded similarly to the vanilla Maxis House of Worship. Note that this building does NOT replace the Maxis House of Worship. Both the ploppable CS$$ and reward versions of the building sit on a 2x2 lot.

    Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided; only one should be used at a time, and the Darknite version requires [this mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) by Simfox (or another nighttime darkening mod). Otherwise, this lot requires no dependencies.

    Enjoy!
