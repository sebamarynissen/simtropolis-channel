    Wells Fargo Plaza

    Based on the real life building in Bloomington, MN, USA

    BAT by IDS2

    Lot/modding/testing by T Wrecks

    So, after over a year of relentlessly tweaking this thing, I'm finally feeling gutsy enough to upload it ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)

    This 300-or-so foot tall midrise office tower is pretty closely based off of its real life counterpart located in a large business corridor in the city of Bloomington in my lovely home state of Minnesota. Built in 1974, it is currently the 2nd-tallest building in the state located outside of either downtown Minneapolis or St. Paul.

    Growable and ploppable version included! Both provide 5,676 CO$$ jobs on a 5x10 lot (transit enabled, baby!)

    This zip file contains Maxisnite and Darknite versions. Darknite version requires Simfox's Day n' Night mod in order to function properly.

    Dependencies:

    [BSC Mega Props CP Vol.1 (for virtually all props)](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)

    [NDEX Essentials (for the base texture)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/12730-ndex-global-essentials-file/)

    [Simfox Day n' Night mod (for Darknite version)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    Modeled in 3dsMax.

    This is my first upload, so if anything is wrong with the building (this also goes for any subsequent uploads), please PM me ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)

    My most sincere thanks go out to T Wrecks who kindly gave this building a breath of life with his spiffy lotting skills ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif) In addition, I would like to thank all the kind people in my [BAT thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/topic/44664-idss-mostly-minnesota-bats/page__st__240) who have supported me over the past year. I couldn't have done it without you guys!
