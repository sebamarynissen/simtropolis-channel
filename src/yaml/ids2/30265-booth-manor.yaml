  summary: Booth Manor
  description: |-
    Located in the Loring Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Booth Manor is a 21-story residential tower that was constructed in 1977. It is currently owned by the Salvation Army and serves as an assisted living community for senior citizens.

    This recreation is a growable R$$ tower that sits on a 2x2 lot. I have also included a ploppable version (static landmark) for those of you who play like I do ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)

    As always, I am offering both Darknite and Maxisnite versions. Download and install only one at a time, or you will pay dearly. The Darknite version requires Simfox's mod, which is available [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    I hope you all enjoy. Please leave feedback below!
