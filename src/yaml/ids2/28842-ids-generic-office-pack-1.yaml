    So, I made both of these a loooong time ago and they've been sitting in a 90% completed state on my hard drive for about a year. I figured if I didn't release them now I'd just forget about them again ![:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaTounge.gif)

    These little buildings may be bland, but they're everywhere in the real world. I personally see them all the time in the suburbs where light industry (warehouses/distribution centers) is concentrated.

    The white building is Anderson Plastics (2x2) and is modded as both a growable and ploppable CO$$. The dark glass building is Brookdale Landscaping (2x3) and is also modded as both a growable and ploppable CO$$.

    Night scenes come in both Maxisnite and Darknite varieties. The Darknite scene requires Simfox's mod available [here.](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) Download and install only one of the two varieties at a time. 

    Enjoy!
