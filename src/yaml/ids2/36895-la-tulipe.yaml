  summary: La Tulipe
  description: |-
    Completed in 1976 and designed by architect Jack Vicajee Bertoli, the Swiss Medical Research Foundation building, nicknamed "La Tulipe" (the Tulip) as a result of its unusual floral shape, is a brutalist landmark located in Geneva, Switzerland.

    Owing to its real life association with medical research, I have modded this version as a clinic (I don't think I've done one of those before, oddly enough). It sits on a 2x2 lot and comes in both Darknite and Maxisnite varieties; only one may be used at a time. The Darknite version requires [Simfox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).

    Enjoy!
