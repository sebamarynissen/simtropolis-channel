    Hiawatha Bank Tower

    Inspired by the First Bank Building in St. Paul, Minnesota

    This is my first foray into anything Art Deco, so be gentle! ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)

    After many tedious hours of previews and exporting, I think it's time that I let this one spread its wings. At 417 feet and 32 stories, this puppy has it all!

    Dependencies: not this time!

    This building sits on a 3x2 lot. Growable and ploppable versions (all with jobs) are included.

    Night scenes are provided in both Maxisnite (for those of you who still use Windows 95 ![:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaTounge.gif)) and Darknite varieties. The darknite scene requires Simfox's mod available [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/). Download and install only one of the two varieties at a time. If you choose to install both (or worse, neither), please note that I am not responsible for any loss of limbs, life, or both. The CAM lots included in this upload require the [Colossus Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30956-colossus-addon-mod/).

    To all of you kind people in my BAT thread and the community, thank you for your continued support!

    UPDATE 7-2-19: Added an additional non-CAM growable lot. Thanks to [@Tyberius06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/660284-tyberius06/) for pointing this out! ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)")
