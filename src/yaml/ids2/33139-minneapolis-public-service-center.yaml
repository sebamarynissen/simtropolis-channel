  summary: Minneapolis Public Service Center
  description: |-
    Built in 1957, the Minneapolis Public Service Center is a 5-story building that sits at the corner of South 4th Street and 3rd Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was designed by Minneapolis-based architectural firm Thorshov and Cerny.

    This building is available as a CS$$ midrise in both growable and ploppable versions. It sits on a 7x3 lot and has 480 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided; only one should be used at a time, and the Darknite version requires [this mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) by Simfox (or another nighttime darkening mod).

    Otherwise, the only dependencies are for the trees I threw on the lot:

    [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01 (v1.0)](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)

    [BSC MEGA Props CP Vol02 (v1.0)](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2790)
