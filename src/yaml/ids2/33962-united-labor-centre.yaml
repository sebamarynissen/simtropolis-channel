  summary: United Labor Centre
  description: |-
    Built in 1974, United Labor Centre is an unassuming office building located at the intersection of Central Avenue SE and University Avenue SE in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

    This model is available as a CO$$ building in both growable and ploppable versions, both of which sit on a 2x4 lot and provide 550 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite options are provided - use only one at a time!

    Dependencies:

    -   [SimFox Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) \- for the Darknite version of the model

    Otherwise, no dependencies are required.
