    **NYBT** **525 West 48th Street**

    This is a small industrial/manufacturing building from New York's neighborhood Hell's Kitchen.

    **Desc****:** Buildings is on 1x2 lot offering 18 jobs for regular and 72 jobs for quadruple version.

    Modding has been done by **anotn**

    **IMPORTANT!!**

    Installation: Extract downloaded file. Depending on whether you use T Wrecks' [Industrial Revolution Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28268-industrial-revolution-mod-base-pack-maxis-lots/) or not either delete **Industrial Revolution Mod\_Zoning** or **Regular\_Zoning** folder**.** After that enter the folder you've left and choose between **Quadruple Lot** and **Regular Lot** folders and delete the one you don't want. After that just place the **NYBT** **525 W 48th Street** folder into your Plugins folder.

    If you choose files from the **Industrial Revolution Mod\_Zoning** folder this building will grow only on medium density (industrial) zones!!
