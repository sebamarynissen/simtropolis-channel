  description: |-
    Red Resident is medium wealth residential building. This is the second BAT I created. I expect your comments and suggestions as usual.

    PS the name is not political, it came up as a short version of Red Residential building ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif))))

    Stats:

    Lot size is 2x4

    Only growable version included (since there is no need for ploppable)

    Dependencies: None
