  summary: Super Green
  description: |-
    The Super Green is medium wealth residential building with 405 residents. Sitting on 2x4 corner lot, it can be w2w or stand alone, either way it looks acceptable. It supposed to be green building, so it needs minimal power, the rest comes from solar panels on top. Also, materials used for renovation provide minimal pollution.
    NO DEPENDENCIES! Landmark and growable provided in folder.

    Night lights and exporting are done by **Amthaak.** Thank you very much for your support  my friend!

    If you remember The Red Resident, you'll see the resemblance. The idea was to modify Red Resident, build around it and make it w2w. I got the original idea from the **gottago**, who posted comment on Red Resident, saying it should be made into w2w. Thank you.

    So comment on this one too, maybe we can come up to some new, fresh ideas.
