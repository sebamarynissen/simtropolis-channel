  summary: abandoned Residential
  description: |-
    It's up for sale!!  This 2 unit residential that sits on a 1x2 lot in low wealth area. It has been abandoned, the windows broken and boarded up. Current owner has installed 2 spot lights on the front to light up the porchway at night to help steer away the homeless/druggies. They do make their way in through a back broken window. I have set this to house 7 R$ sims to accomodate this fact in game. no ploppable lot with this one, just a grow residential.
