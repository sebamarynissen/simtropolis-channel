  summary: WTW Fire Dept
  description: |-
    While building my low wealth WTW area in my city....I had a fire and the fire station did not fit in well at all,, and so this low wealth fire dept was constructed. The lot is 1x2 and garages 2 fire trucks. It has a medium coverage radius and costs 3,000 to plop.
