  summary: Marlin Hotel
  description: |-
    This is my second BAT. As you can see I'm getting better at this but still have a ways to go.

    It is a landmark with no jobs and is based on the Marlin Hotel on South Beach. No night lights as I still have to learn that as well as the jobs part. It fits on a 2x2 lot and plop cost 110,000. The pics are one in game and one in 3dsmax render.
