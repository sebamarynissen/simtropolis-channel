  summary: Mikes Mini Mart
  description: |-
    This lot is low wealth corner lot. It sits on a 2x2 lot and it is a run down mini market. The half wall has graffitti on it, the sign above the entrance is missing the left part of it. The pole sign has holes on each side of it as well. The garbage dumpster is full and there are garbage bags sitting on the ground next to it. The lot has 3 newspaper stands left of the door and a coke and pepsi machine to the far right. A poster sign on this wal advertises Bud Light. This lot provides 11 C$ jobs and comes with a grow and plop version. This lot is one of my favorite low wealth and works well with my other W2W lots.
