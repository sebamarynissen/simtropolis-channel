  description: |-
    This lot is designed for use as W2W, but can be stand alone with parking or whatnot placed around it. This is a very low wealth lot with a grocer and lounge/bar on the ground floor and 7 floors of apartments. The lot is 1x2. There is a grow version and a plop version supplying just 18 CS$ jobs. There is also a residential version included which houses 65 R$ sims.
