  description: |-
    Cody's Roadhouse Grill. It is a low wealth 1x2 lot with the diner taking up the ground and first floor level. The remaining three levels are used for small office spaces. This employs 85 c$ sims, and costs 6,000 to plop. The building is designed for WTW but can be used alone if you place parking along side of it. The zip files includes the plop version as well as a grow version.
