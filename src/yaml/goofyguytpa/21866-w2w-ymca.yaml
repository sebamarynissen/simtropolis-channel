  summary: W2W YMCA
  description: |-
    It's the "Y"......I created a W2W downtown version of this historic association. This sits on a corner 2x2 lot and stands 3 stories high. 3 versions are included in the zip file. A plop version, a grow C$$ version and a R$$ version. The plop and grow versions supply 65 C$$ jobs and the R$$ version houses 75 sims representing people staying at the "Y"
