  summary: Euclid Hotel
  description: |-
    This is modeled after the Park Place Hotel in Miami, South Beach and is a landmark version with no jobs. Has no night lights eaither as I just can't get them to work. Thought people still my like it for their cities. The plop cost is 45,000.

    P.S.

    should some one want any of my models in 3ds to do night lights just say so and I will upload
