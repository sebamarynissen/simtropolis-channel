  description: |-
    Thisbuildinghas 8 floors and sits on a 2x2 lot. It's in style of the old Woolworth's stores andI designed it as a W2W type building a few month's ago and decided to upload it as part of mt series.It's not modeled after any particular store, but rather one I came up with for my city. There is a grow version and a plop version included providing 110 CS$ jobs.
