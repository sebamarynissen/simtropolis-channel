  summary: W2W Corner Wendys
  description: |-
    Heeeeere's Wendy! Another one of my corner w2w fast foods. Wendy sits on a corner 1x2 lot. I wanted this across from my ToysRUs building in my city so this one has a billboard atop of it unlike my others. There is a grow and plop version lot and they each supply 42 CS$ jobs.
