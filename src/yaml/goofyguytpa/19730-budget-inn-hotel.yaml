  summary: Budget Inn Hotel
  description: |-
    This lot is a low wealth hotel that sits on an outer corner of a road. See pics for better clarification. It was something specific i needed and thought I'd upload for anyone else who might like  lot such as this. It is designed for W2W and pic shows how this looks once built that way in game, but can be used alone with parking plopped around it or something. It is a ploppable lot only as a lot like this can not grow correctly. It does supply 21 C$ jobs.
