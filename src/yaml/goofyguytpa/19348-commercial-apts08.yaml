  summary: Commercial Apts08
  description: |-
    This low wealth also has windows and doors in the back unlike my others as I have an alley that runs behind it in my city. It sits on a 1x2 lot and provides 65 C$ jobs. It costs $6,000 to plop. The zip includes a plop lot and a growable lot. There is also a grow residential lot included that houses 120 R$ sims.
