  description: |-
    This another of my art deco/south beach style hotel buildings. This one sits on a 3x2 lot. The sides are designed so that it may be used W2W if desired or plop parking/etc around it. There is a grow and plop version supplying 22 CS$$ jobs and to simulate people staying/living in the hotel there is a grow residential lot housing 22 R$$ sims.
