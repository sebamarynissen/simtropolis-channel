  summary: Brownstones01
  description: |-
    Low wealth brownstones designed to help make the lower class neighborhoods look more realistic and keeping in line with my commercial apts whereas the side streets don't usually have buisinesses. This is a growable r$ lot which houses 30 sims, and for those who wish to place the lot exactly where they want as eyecandy, there is a ploppable landmark version included.
