  summary: W2W Offices 01
  description: |-
    Here comes a lot with 2 office buildings that are w2w. One building is 6 stories high and the other is 5. This lot is a 1x2 and provides 120 CO$$ jobs. My demand for office jobs kept increasing so I designed a few of these for my W2W city. There is a plop version and a grow version included.
