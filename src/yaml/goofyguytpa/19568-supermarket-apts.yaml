  summary: Supermarket Apts
  description: |-
    Lot size on this is 1x2. The building has a supermarket on the ground floor and 3 floors of low wealth residential apartments above the supermarket. It is designed for W2W but doesn't have to be. There are three lots in the zip file..a plop version and a grow C$ version each supplying 40 C$ jobs. Third lot is a grow residential lot housing 63 R$ sims. I re-set this lot to sit back 2 meters as I noticed some of you mentioning they stick out that far with other lots. I only use my lots for this particular city and did not know that. All other lots I post will have this 2 meter set back.....hope that helps.
