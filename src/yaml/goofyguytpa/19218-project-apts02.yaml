    For your low wealth area and can be WTW, here is an old building with pealing paint and graffiti . Bottom floor has a Bar & Grill only supplying 16 c$ jobs. A plop lot and grow lot are included.The apts above are only partially lived in and the vacant ones have broken windows with tattered curtains left behind. There is a grow residential lot also included housing just 42 sims in the occupied apts.
