  summary: High Wealth Row Houses
  description: |-
    this zip file contains 8 lot variations of my high wealth rowhomes. The lots are 2x2 and three rowhomes sit on each lot for a total combo of 24 houses. The bottom level of these have a sunken drive into the garage and there are 3 levels of living space above the garage. Shown here are the 8 different lots but only one at night to give an idea how they look at night. All lots have a porch light on the front door and back as well as the rooftop doors. All garages also have an outside light.  These are single family houses so they only supply housing for 21 sims per lot (3 houses). These lots are growable.
