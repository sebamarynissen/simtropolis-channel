  description: |-
    This is another of my 1x2 low wealth w2w lots. This one has 2 shops on the ground floor..a check cashing joint and a run down bar. there are 7 floors of apartments above the shops. The zip file includes a plop and grow version supplying only 16 CS$ jobs as these are small places. There is a grow residential version included as well supplying 120 R$ sims.
