  summary: W2W Apartment Pack
  description: |-
    These apartments are low wealth and designed for W2W use. Unlike my Commercial Apts, these do not have commercial services on the ground floor...they are all residential. There are 7 lots included and all sit on a 2x2 lot and have a combined total of 17 buildings from 5 stories tall up to 9 stories tall. Some have garbage cans out front and a couple have graffitti. Most have bars on the windows on the ground level apartments.  These lots are growable only and each lot houses 160 R$ sims.
