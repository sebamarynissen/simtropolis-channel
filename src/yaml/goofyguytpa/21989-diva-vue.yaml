    No seedy part of town is complete without the naughty girls......and here they are. This lot is a 1x2 designed for W2W use and has a ground floor business of "showgirls". It also contains 6 floors of low wealth apartments. The zip contains a grow and plop version supplying 48 CS$ jobs. There is also a grow residential version housing 76 R$ sims.
