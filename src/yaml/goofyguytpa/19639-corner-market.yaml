  summary: Corner Market
  description: |-
    Part of my W2W low wealth collection, this lot works just as well without placing it W2W. Lot size is 2x2 and has been used and abused. Paint is peeling off the walls and graffitti along the side and some on front of building. It has a corner pole sign which has been broken out in some places. It boasts the red, white and blue colors hence the flag artwork with the graffitti. Stairs along the side lead to living quarters upstairs. Zip file has plop and grow version employing 11 C$ sims. If you'd like to use the lot for residential then there is also a residential grow lot housing 6 R$ sims.
