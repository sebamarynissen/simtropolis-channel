  summary: Building 4 Sale
  description: |-
    This is another one of my low wealth W2W lots designed really for the high drug/crime area. The building is vacant and has a for sale banner on the front. It has broken and boarded up windows with ground floor having bars to try and keep out intruders. The file contains a plop landmark version and a grow residential version housing 11 sims. This is to represent the homeless that has managed to get inside and call it home.
