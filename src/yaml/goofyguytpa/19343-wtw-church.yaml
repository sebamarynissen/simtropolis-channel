  summary: WTW Church
  description: |-
    And now, with all the pimps and druggies and so forth in the low wealth neighborhood, now comes the Lord to make himself present. Here is a low wealth church lot simply called Christ Church. It will fit WTW if you desire....or not. It sits on a 1x2 lot and shows up in the landmark menu.

    P.S.

    I don't make these lots this quick. I have quite a few that I have made over the last year and a half. I just recently learned the nightlighting though and as I add night lights I share them on here for anyone interested...just wanted y'all to know.
