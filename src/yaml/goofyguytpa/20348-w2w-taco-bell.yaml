  summary: W2W Taco Bell
  description: |-
    Here is another one of my W2W corner restaurants. This one being Taco Bell. I tend to like the old style sign they had better than the new one they used and so I used it fot this BAT. It sits on a 1x2 corner lot and supplies 57 CS$ jobs. There is a grow version and plop version included.
