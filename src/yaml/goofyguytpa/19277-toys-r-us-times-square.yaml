  summary: Toys R Us Times Square
  description: |-
    Did this thing a while ago but never uploaded cause it's not 100% accurate but awful close. It was something I needed for a section in my city. thought a few might like it though so here it is. It sits on an 8x4 lot and is a plopable landmark and costs 18,000 to plop. No jobs but I thought the night lighting looked kinda cool.
