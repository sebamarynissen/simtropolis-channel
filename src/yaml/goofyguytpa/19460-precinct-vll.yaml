  summary: Precinct Vll
  description: |-
    It's the law, y'all. It is my low wealth lot designed for WTW usage but doessn't have to be of course. It has Precinct Vll carved in the stone above the doorway, a lighted police sign in the starway. Also has a coke machine with newsstands and pepsi machine with newsstands. This lot is 2x2, provides 8 dispatch cars and 50 cells. Costs 6000 to plop and 250 monthly.
