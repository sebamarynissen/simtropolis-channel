  summary: Older Offices
  description: |-
    This is a 5 story office building on a 1x2 lot. Nothing extremely fancy but  resembling older type govt building. Not much night lighting added to this as they are closed and unoccupied at night. There is a grow and plop version included supplying 125 CO$$ jobs.
