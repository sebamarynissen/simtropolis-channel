  summary: Parking Garage
  description: |-
    Designed to look like an old, bit of a run down parking garage. It sits on a 2x2 lot. I use it as part of my W2W in game but the building does have finished sides as well as finished back for those not wanting to use it as W2W. It has 5 levels of parking.
