  summary: Mariner Inn
  description: |-
    This building sits on a 1x2 lot. A very art deco style and can be used W2W or alone with parking/etc placed around it. Basically a hotel, it also has a mini mart. The grow version supplies 23CS$$ jobs. There is also a grow residential version to simulate a few people living there and houses  15 R$$ sims. There is a plop version in here as well, but I did not add jobs to it. There are no dependencies.
