  description: |-
    Check it out....with the profits I've made from being a slumlord, I've aquired a med wealth apt building. this building sits on a 1x2 lot, and has 7 floors of apts. Although it has windows on the sides, it has been designed so that it does fit W2W, or as a stand alone with parking or whatever placed around it. The growable lot houses 116 R$$ sims. A plop version is also included with no stats, just eyecandy
