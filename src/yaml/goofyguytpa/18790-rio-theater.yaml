  summary: Rio Theater
  description: |-
    This was modeled after the original RIO Theater and is designed to fit wtw. Lot size is 2x2 and costs 9,000 to plop.  The marquee is modeled as a seperate prop so that it will hang over the sidewalk. Zip file includes landmark version. Sorry but no lights. Got them to work in 3ds max but spent 10 hrs a day for 4 days trying to get them to work in game with no luck so gave up
