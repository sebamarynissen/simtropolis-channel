  summary: Project Apts03
  description: |-
    Another low wealth lot that can be used WTW if you like. This one has two buildings on a 1x2 lot. The shorter building is vacant with graffiti and a couple broken and boarded up windows. The taller building is in business, but barely. top floor has a broken window and this building has graffiti as well on the front and along the side It supplies just 35 jobs. There is both a plop and grow version included. The apts above do have some residents so there is a grow residential lot also that houses 55 sims.

    My video card went kerplunk so the pics are not as good as they should be
