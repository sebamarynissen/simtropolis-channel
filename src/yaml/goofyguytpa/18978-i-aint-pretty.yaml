  summary: I Aint Pretty
  description: |-
    No we all can't be beautiful and this one sure isn't. It can be WTW and is quite run down. A great one for a slum area. Ground level is a closed up shop with boarded windows and doors and and now shows off the talent of the local artists on it's walls. The apartmemt floors have boarded up windows as well as few that are not but have broken glass. Obviously has no employees or residents so therefore it is a landmark only lot.
