  summary: Modular Warehouse Pack
  description: |-
    This is my first set of lots.  
      
    It contains 25 lots for making large industrial warehouse complexes. Pityful enough they are complete and pure eye candy. I did my best to minimize the effects in game.  
      
    Someday I will find an ingame purpose and a way to implement that. That will be version 2.  
      
    The list of dependencies is long, so be warned. I'd advise you to take this set into your plugins only if you use JeStarr's megapacks already. Cogeo's Logistics Centre are a must for everyone who is interested in my lots. You will need them anyway, so why not plop these also into your industrial areas?  
      
    I updated the list, because there was a flaw.  
    Please look in the ReadMe. The list is there, complete with links for easy download.  
      
    Now take a look and please feedback in [my thread](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=9146.0) on SC4 Devotion.
