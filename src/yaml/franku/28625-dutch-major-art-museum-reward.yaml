    **The Lot**

    This Dutch Mayor Art Museum is part of my set of Dutch Reward Lots that replace the Maxis Rewards. The set is meant to be used as an add on to the Dutch Farm Lots that I am making and that will be released someday.

    The lot replaces the Maxis Major Art Museum. It has exactly the same stats. The size is 6 x 6 tiles.

    **The Story**

    This lot is *not* a replacement of your town hall, because in this simulated city we already have a Dutch town hall: the Dutch City Hall Reward. You can get that [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27987-dutch-city-hall-reward/).

    And so in game we have the risk of abandonment of this beautiful monument. Hence mayor and alderman came together and called for their urban planner in charge. They did some brainstorming and came up with the idea of redevelop it as the Major Art Museum that the city was asking for.

    Some councilors however preferred to rent the building to a group of cooperating High Tech software developers that were looking for a high brow location to present themselves and develop their nifty apps. In order to appease these councilors we also give you the choice to plop this lot as a Landmark with IHT jobs.

    And for those who only want to admire the sheer beauty of this elaborate brick edifice we offer you an additional straightforward Landmark.

    **The Dependencies**

    As the lot is meant as an add on to the Dutch Farm Lots I used mostly dependencies that are already needed for that set. You nee the following ones:

    [BSC\_TexturePack\_Cycledogg\_V 01b](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=101)

    [BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01.dat](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)

    [BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01.dat](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=746)

    [BSC Textures Vol 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=90)

    [BNL Essentials V1.1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28639-bnl-essentials/)

    The only additional file is the download of the Meurdoos Model. You need only the \*.model file. You can delete the lot file that goes with this download, but of course you can leave it if you like: then you also have Meurdoos original lot. You can get it [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22052-raadhuis-hilversum/).

    Have fun!
