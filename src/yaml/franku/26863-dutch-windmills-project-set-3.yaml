  summary: FrankU Dutch Windmills Project Set 3
  description: |-
    The third set of my Dutch Windmills Project contains four lots based on Meurdoos Wipmolen.  
    I am not a windmill fanatic, so I cannot tell you very much about the mill. It is just a very Dutch mill and before the introduction of steam power there were an enormous amount of these mills in the Netherlands. In fact we can speak of an industrial revolution that had taken place in the 15th and 16th century, powered by windmills.  
      
    The mills took their energy from the wind and the Wipmolen was often used as power source for pumping up water to keep the lower areas dry. So I guessed to use these lots as water sources seemed maybe not obvious, but at least more or less acceptable. And fun for playing the game, right?  
    The properties are based on the Maxis aquifer water tower as present in the SC4-Pim utility.

    I also added eyecandy Landmarks versions of the lots. The separate upload with landmarks versions of all windmills has been deleted.

    **The dependencies**  
      
    As always: quite a lot of them, but be aware that you will have many lots whith these files. My upcoming set of Dutch farms, to which this is an antedates add-on, contains at the moment already 50 farms in four growth stages.
