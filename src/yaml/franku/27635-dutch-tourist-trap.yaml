  summary: FrankU Dutch Tourist Trap
  description: |-
    This Dutch Tourist Trap is part of my set of Dutch Reward Lots that replace the Maxis Rewards. The set is meant to be used as an add on to the Dutch Farm Lots that I am making and that will be released someday.  
    The lot replaces the Maxis Tourist Trap. It has exactly the same stats. The size is 4 x 4 tiles.  
      
    A Dutch Tourist Trap should contain a windmill, shouldn't it? So for this lot I chose the animated version of the Stellingmolen by Meurdoos.  
    In the Netherlands the VVV Office is the place where tourists can get informed about hotel reservations and interesting sites, where they can buy maps, postcards, books and can generally be stuffed with info. Every town and village has a VVV Office. These are definitely tourist traps.  
    For a realistic VVV appearance the lot contains three specially made sing props. MrMAvE94 made them when he saw the first version of this lot in my thread on SC4Devotion.  
      
    The market stalls on the lot enhance the Trap aspect of the lot. They are almost unavoidable and the salesmen and -women are convinced to provide the visitors a proper opportunity to enrich their suitcases with original Dutch products. For a list of available products take a look [here](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=9146.msg423654#msg423654).  
      
    Yes, there is a lot to choose from when you visit the Netherlands!  
      
    **Landmark version**  
    I added a CS§§ landmark to this upload, so if you prefer the Maxis Tourist trap you can use this lot as a ploppable commercial add-on to your cities.  
      
    **The Dependencies**  
    As the lot is meant as an add on to the Dutch Farm Lots I used mostly dependencies that are already needed for that set.

    For Version 2 you also need:

    And a special thanks goes to **MrMAvE94** for the VVV signs he provided for this lot.  
      
    I hope you will have fun!
