  description: |-
    **Heblem** submitted a set of terrain props in 2010.

    It contained sand props that could be painted onto the terrain. I thought that these props would be useful for making paths and trails, but they are too large for that.

    So I used [Model Tweaker](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2072) to make smaller props.

    Now I can offer you the four sand textures by **Heblem** in two smaller sizes: *Small* and *Extra Small*.

    You can paint them on your terrain, you can use them on your lots.

    **Dependency**

    You need one dependency for the set to work:

    **[HBS Flora Prop Pack vol.01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24398-hbs-flora-prop-pack-vol01/)**

    If you want **Heblems** original MMP's too you also need:

    [HBS Tropical Flora Pack (Mayor Mode)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24399-hbs-tropical-flora-pack-mayor-mode/)

    I made the props, **Paeng** made the MMP's. Thank you **Paeng**!

    Have fun!
