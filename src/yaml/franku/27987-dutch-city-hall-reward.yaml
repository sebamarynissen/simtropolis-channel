  summary: Dutch City Hall Reward
  description: |-
    This is another Dutch Reward lot that replaces the Maxis rewards.  
    In this case it is three lots. Maxis intended the City Hall to have three growth stages, but only Stage 1 made it into the game. A long time ago MrTruesage made a fix that revealed the two other stages to the players. I used this mod, and a lot of dependencies, to make these three lots for your game.  
      
    The lots are quite large: 6x8 tiles. This would perhaps require some tuning of the original properties of the rewards, but I did not change these. In the readme you can see what the properties are. So the behavior of the lots is identical to the behavior of the original Maxis lots. I did not intend to screw up your game!  
      
    For fun and versatility I added also a set of simple Landmarks and a set of Landmarks with CS jobs to the upload. Use whichever you want and you can delete the other files. They are all in separate folders.  
      
    All details are in the readme.  
      
    No panic, here are the dependecies:  
    **City hall mod, in order to be able to use all three stages**  
    \- [English version on STEX](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11154-all-3-cityhalls-modd-reward-fix/)  
    \- [German version on SimCity Kurier](http://kurier.simcityplaza.de/details.php?file=280)  
      
    **You need only the model files of the following:**  
    [The old town hall](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15696-dutch-townhall-haarlem/)  
    [The second building](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20177-vda-utrecht-nobelstraat-4-twentsche-bank/)  
    [The third building](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/17705-dutch-offices-amsterdam-drentepark/)  
    These models are by Haarlemmergold and Vanderaap, two of the better BATters from my own country. How can I ever thank them?
