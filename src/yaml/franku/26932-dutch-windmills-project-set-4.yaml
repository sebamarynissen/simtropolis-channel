  summary: FrankU Dutch Windmills Project Set 4
  description: |-
    So this is my fourth and probably last set of Dutch Windmills.  
    This one is a small mill that I gave **the function of a water treatment plant**.

    I also provided eyecandy Landmarks versions.  
    The images you see give just a rough idea, because I again used several prop families on every lot, so each plop looks a bit different.  
      
    I hope you like this set too.  
      
    The Dependencies  
      
    Again a lot of dependencies, but they are identical to what you need for the other three sets.  
    In the Read Me you will find an exact list including links.  
      
    You only need to download additionally one file: the windmill model itself. It is made by Lord\_Quillian2 and you can find it [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/2378-nutley-windmill/). You will need only the model file.  
      
    Have fun!
