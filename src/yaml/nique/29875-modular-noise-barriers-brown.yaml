  description: |-
    This is my first BAT ever. Worked a full week on it.. With this set you can beautify your highways, railroad tracks, you name it. This plugin contains overhanging pieces to allow you still plopping highway signs or other stuff along your highway. Don't forget to check back for updated versions (click "follow this file" button). The next version will have diagonal pieces. Have fun!

    **Dependencies**

    NONE!  ![:party:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaParty.gif)  *(you happy!?) (you should be!)*

    **Installation**

    Extract the zip file to your plugins folder. It doesn't really matter where.
    You don't need both downloads. Just one. The unpacked version is for people who have trouble with the packed one.

    **Usage:**
    \- You can find the pieces most likely all the way down in your 'parks' menu.
    \- Flatten out the terrain before you place them. It absolutely needs a flat terrain to be nice. Sadly enough.. align to slope just didn't work.

    \- No corners (sorry but this was already a tremendous amount of work, maybe in the future)

    **Donate?**
    You don't have to, but it's welcome ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif). I'm a poor disabled sucker.. Motivates me to create more!
