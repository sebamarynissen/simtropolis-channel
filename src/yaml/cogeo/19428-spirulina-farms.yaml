    Spirulina is blue-green micro-algae, sold as hygienic food, dietary supplement and astronaut food.

    This pack contains two growable agricultural industry (I-R) stage-3 lots, sized 5x4 and 6x4. There is also a ploppable 6x4 lot and ploppable farm-fields, 3x2-large. The plugin can be configured for either SC4/RH or the Colossus Addon Mod (CAM). The 1x1-large farmfields grow with the farm (as usual) and can be configured to show all-same tubs (selected randomly and changed simultaneously twice a year) or various tubs or both. The 3x2-large farm-fields are ploppable (technical restrictions do not allow "real" farm-fields larger than 1x1), use bigger tub models, and change seasonaly (7 times a year). The pack contains 19 new BAT models in total.
