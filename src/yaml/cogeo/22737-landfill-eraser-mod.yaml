  summary: Landfill Eraser Mod
  description: |-
    Tired of never decaying trash heaps? Disappointed of other methods (meteors, volcanoes etc)? Then this mod might be for you!

    Landfills are notorious for their slow decay rates. The remaining 2x2 garbage heap may take decades to decompose. Even worse, there is a known bug, causing anomalous-shaped trash heaps, like the ones in the pic. Such heaps actually never go away, as the trash "lots" are corrupted. WIth this mod (and possibly some additional steps), you can erase and dezone even such heaps.

    The mod is very simple in its concept, it just sets the garbage decay rate to 100%. As a result all trash in landfills disappears and the landfill zones can be dezoned. In the case of irregularly-shaped trash heaps some few extra steps may be required.

    Some players may be tempted to use this as a cheat, however the purpose of this mod wasn't this, it was to make it possible to easily get rid of the remaining 2x2 trash heap or the anomalous trash heaps. Install it, do your job and then uninstall it. It is also highly recommended that you backup your region before attempting erasing your landfills.

    See the readme for details and tips.

    Enjoy!
