  summary: Navy Set 1
  description: |-
    A set of US Navy ships to use as part of a puzzle-piece navy base.  Included are a Nimitz class aircraft carrier, an Arleigh Burke class Flight IIA destroyer, and a Fleet Replenishment Oiler.  All ships are designed to be placed next to existing industrial style waterfronts.  A brow comes off each ship and extends off the lot to provide sim sailors access.  All lots show up in the seaport menu (below the SNM navy lots (not required) if you happen to have them).

    All lots are meant to be eye candy only and have negligible game functionally.

    **Dependencies**

    None!

    The ships look good placed next to CDK, SNM, and NBVC waterfronts, but none are required.

    **Installation**

    Just download and unzip/extract in your Plugins folder.  You can delete any ships (model and lot file) for any you donâ€™t want.

    **Notes on Usage**

    To properly place a ship next to a pier, follow the instructions in the readme (or if you are like me, just figure it out by trial and error!  It isn't hard).
