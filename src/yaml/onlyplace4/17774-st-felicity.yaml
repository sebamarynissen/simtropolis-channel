  summary: BLaM St Felicity
  description: |-
    Legend says that Saint Felicity fell in love with a shepherd but, due to her vows, their love was never to be. Such was her sorrow that Felicity faded away, but confessed her love for the humble shepherd on her deathbed. Her confessor saw this as a sin and condemned Felicity to live for all eternity only when it was night, and the shepherd to live for all eternity when it was day.

    This church, which is name in memory of my late mother and not an actual saint, is based loosely on the church found in the game Oblivion. It is pure-eye-candy only, and and sits on a 6x4 lot. As the saint was condemned to never meet her shepherd ... watch the statues on the saint and shepherd that stand on the plinths in the church grounds.

    The church is made from two props as this was necessary to facilitate the night lighting whilst keeping the windows during the day quite dark. There are also a series of custom gravestones, 2 statues, a plinth and a above ground mausoleum. All these props are contained in the file BLaM\_St\_Felicity.dat which also contains the two church models and the blank used to create the lot. All other props on the lot are the standard Maxis props.

    **NB:** Due to the lot using individual props for day and night you may find that when you plop the building the windows will initially be lit up. This effect will cancel very shortly after the lot is plopped or the game is run.
