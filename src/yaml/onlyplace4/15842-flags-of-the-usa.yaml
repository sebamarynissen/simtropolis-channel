  summary: Flags of the USA
  description: |-
    This is a prop file containing 52 flags of the USA being all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and the USA flag. Each flag can be found in the Lot Editor with the prefix *Flag\_US*, so for Texas you would need *Flag\_US Texas*. I have done this as I intend to do more flags, and they will all have a similar prefix (i.e. *Flag\_UK*) so you can easily identify them within the lot editor.

    If you use any of these flags in lots you release please do not include this file with your release without my permission, but instead please point your dependency to this file. Thank you.

    **To instal**

    Simply unzip the required .dat file to your plugins folder.

    If you download and use, please comment and rate.
