    As these are props there are no statistics. You are free to use these props in anyway you feel fit, but please do not include the props with any files you release, but instead point users to this file as a dependency. Many thanks.

    **To instal**

    BLaM recommends the making of a folder named BLaM within your plugins folder. The contents of the folder contained within the download zip archive may then be dragged directly to that folder.

    **Release Notes**
