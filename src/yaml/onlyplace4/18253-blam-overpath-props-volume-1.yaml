  summary: BLaM Overpath Props Volume 1
  description: |-
    Some time ago I got to thinking that it was rather odd that cars in SimCity 4 have to drive over the sidewalk to reach any parking lot or house. Not very realistic. That's why I came up with these four very simple props for you to use to add that little extra touch of realism to the game.

    The four props are:

    **BLaMOverpathType1**: to be used with overlay textures 0x25913000, 0x25923000, 0x25933000, 0x25943000, 0x25953000, 0x25963000, 0x25973000, 0x259b3000, 0x259c3000, 0x25a03000, 0x25c43000, 0x26220000, 0x26230000, 0x26293000

    **BLaMOverpathType2**: to be used with overlay textures 0x25a22000, 0x25a32000, 0x25a42000, 0x25a52000, 0x25a62000, 0x25a72000, 0x25a82000, 0x25ac2000, ox25ad2000, 0x25b12000, 0x25c52000, 0x26282000

    **BLaMOverpathType3**: to be used with overlay textures 0x25b31000, 0x25b51000, 0x25b61000, 0x25b71000, 0x25bd1000, 0x25c21000

    **BLaM OverpathType4**: to be used with overlay textures 0x25e00000, 0x25e50000, 0x25e60000, 0x25e70000, 0x25f50000, 0x25f60000

    These props have been colour corrected (as far as is humanly possible) for in-game. They will not appear to be the right colour in the Lot Editor, so please do not worry. As you can see from the pictures the props do match the Maxis textures very closely.

    The props are all slightly oversize so that they will work with Roads, Avenues and Streets. However, positioning them for a street is a matter of some trial and error. Picture 2 shows the correct alignment in the Lot Editor for these props when used with Roads and Avenues. Picture 1 shows all four in use next to a blank entrance to demonstrate the increase in realism these simple little props provide. Also provided is a picture of the standard Maxis hospital with and without the overpath prop - you can see the added realism!

    If you have any questions regarding the use of these props please do not hesitate to contact me either at SimTropolis or SimCities.

    As these are props there are no statistics.

    If you use these props in lots you subsequently release please do not include them with your release, but instead please point the downloader to this file as a dependency. Thanks.

    To instal

    BLaM recommends the making of a folder named BLaM within your plugins folder. The contents of the folder contained within the download zip archive may then be dragged directly to that folder.
