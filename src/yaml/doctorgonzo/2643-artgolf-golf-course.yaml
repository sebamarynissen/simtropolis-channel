  summary: ArtGolf golf course
  description: |-
    This is a set of realistically-scaled golf holes. It consists of six par 3 holes, six par 4 holes, two par 5 holes, and one combination par 4/par 5. It also includes a clubhouse and filler tiles to fill in the course.

    Keep in mind that these lots are HUGE! I made these for the realistic region I am working on. If you want a golf course that looks like a golf course, download these lots!
