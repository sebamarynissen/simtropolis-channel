  description: |-
    **History:**

    A trireme (/ˈtraɪriːm/ TRY-reem; derived from Latin: trirēmis "with three banks of oars"; 'triērēs,literally "three-rower") was an ancient vessel and a type of galley that was used by the ancient maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean Sea, especially the Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Romans.

    **Specs:**

    The file contains an 6x2 lot. You can plop in the water or on the ground (You can also use MMP under or around the model).

    **Night:**

    I do not consider it necessary to add night lighting.

    **You can find the building in the Lot Editor as:**

    AGC\_Trireme\_Rome\_Generic\_V01\_S1\_90

    **Ubication:** Water transportation.

    **Scale of the models:** **133% on all axes.**

    **Installation:**

    **Unzip the "Barroco Hispano DLCs" in your Plugins Folder (I highly recommend respecting my folder system because I plan to export or update thousands of BATs).**

    **Every dollar will be used to buy more models for SimCity 4. ![*:thumb:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_44.gif "*:thumb:")**
