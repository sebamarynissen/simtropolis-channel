  summary: Allure of the Seas
  description: |-
    **History:**

    Allure of the Seas is an Oasis-class cruise ship owned and operated by Royal Caribbean International. As of 2018, the Oasis class ships were the largest passenger vessels ever in service, and Allure is 50 millimetres (2.0 in) longer than her sister ship Oasis of the Seas, though both were built to the same specifications. Designed under the name "Project Genesis", she was ordered from Aker Finnyards in February 2006 and her construction began at the Perno shipyard, Turku, Finland, in February 2008. She was named in May 2008 after a contest was held to name her and her sister. The keel of Allure of the Seas was laid on 2 December 2008, shortly after the shipyard had been acquired by STX Europe.

    Upon her launch in November 2009, she became the world's largest passenger ship, taking the place of Oasis of the Seas. She was eclipsed by her sister ship Harmony of the Seas upon its launch in June 2015. Harmony of the Seas has an overall length of 362.12 metres (1,188.1 ft).

    **Specs**:

    The file contains an 6x31 lot (You can put mmp's below the model).

    It is unlikely that I will add a night version as it would take me days to render.
