    **History**

    TSS Lorina was a passenger vessel built for the London and South Western Railway in 1918.

    On 29th May 1940 SS Lorina was off the beaches when caught in a dive-bombing attack and suffered a direct hit amidships which broke her back, the vessel going down in shallow water despite the determined efforts of skipper Captan A. Light to beach her. 8 Crewmen lost their lives. 2 Days later the wreck was boarded by men from the Destroyer Winchelsea who lowered undamaged lifeboats from the LorinaÂ´s davits & used them to ferry troops from the beaches.
