    **I will update this prop pack constantly so you must be on the lookout.**

    **Scale of the model:** **133% on all axes.**

    **Installation:**

    **Unzip the "Barroco Hispano DLCs" in your Plugins Folder (I highly recommend respecting my folder system because I plan to export or update thousands of BATs).**

    **You can make voluntary contributions to support me in continuing to create more content for SimCity 4 (I decided to use Paypal instead of Patreon because I want everyone to have access to my content). ![*:thumb:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_44.gif "*:thumb:")**
