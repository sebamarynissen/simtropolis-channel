  summary: USS Forrest Sherman DD-931 1958
  description: |-
    **History:**

    Forrest Sherman was laid down by the Bath Iron Works Corporation at Bath, Maine, on 27 October 1953, launched on 5 February 1955 by Mrs. Forrest P. Sherman, widow of Admiral Sherman and commissioned on 9 November 1955, Commander R. S. Crenshaw in command.

    After a year of initial training and fitting out, Forrest Sherman arrived at her home port, Newport, R.I., 15 January 1957. Two days later she sailed for Washington, D.C., where she was open for public visiting during the week of the second inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. From Newport, Forrest Sherman sailed on training and fleet exercises along the east coast and in the Caribbean, until the summer of 1957, when she took part in the midshipman cruise to South America and the International Naval Review in Hampton Roads on 12 June.
