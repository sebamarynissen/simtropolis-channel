    **History**

    Sandcrawlers, originally called digger crawlers, were huge mobile fortresses used by the Jawas as their transport and shelter in the deserts of Tatooine and Arvala-7. They were equipped with a magnetic suction tube for sucking droids and scrap into the cargo hold. They also contained cargo holds, scrap-processing facilities, and quarters for crew and passengers. They were large enough to fit an entire Jawa clan.

    **Specs**:

    The file contains an Jawa Sandcrawler. Plop it on flat ground (You can also use MMP around the model).

    **Night:**

    Maxis Night & Darknite **(Choose only one)**
