  summary: small Fachwerk Houses
  description: |-
    Along the Rhine there are many villages and towns with old Houses like those of this set. They have been constructed by poor farmers since more then 500 years. Inthis file are included three Lots with different houses and a foundation file that simulates a cellar. The houses will grow in Euro style stage 2 and are designed for 8 R$-Sims.

    Sorry, I forgot to mention the dependencies:

    BSC Mega Props CP Vol. 1

    BSC Mega Props JES Vol. 2
