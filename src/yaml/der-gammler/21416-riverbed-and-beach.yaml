    Hi,

    This is a set of draggable sediments you can find everywhere: gravel, grey and brown sand. Additionally a snow-tile is included for designing permanent snowfields. The set can be used like mayormod-trees and in combination with other sets like ploppable water, flora pastures but also arond lots.

    Dependencies: none

    Installation: There is a folder for the einglish and one for the german version contained. Select one and extract it to your simcity4-Plugins- folder .

    Enjoy it!
