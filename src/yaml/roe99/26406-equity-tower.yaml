    Equity Tower BAT Model by Roe99

    This is my second building that I created using 3dsmax, my experience in creating buildings using 3dsmax is zero, then I still need a lot to learn from the legendary creator of the BAT such HKBT, NYBT, BSC, etc. with the limitations of my PC specs, I keep trying to present the best so far that I could do. any comments, suggestions, and criticisms are welcome, I would love to hear any feedback from you

    Uninstall:

    Remove all files from your /My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins directory

    Note:

    night view mode is available only dark night, then in suggest you use the[SimFox Day 'n' Nite Modd 1](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-n-nite-modd/) for better appearance

    In order to see night lighting, you need to have the EP1 Update 1 for Rush Hour/Deluxe installed, and then afterwards install the patch specifically for the BAT nightlighting, available on the "Building Architect Tool" page on the official Maxis website. It is a separate download because it is optional. Note that you must be logged in to see the link.

    If you do not have this installed, no custom model you

    download will display any lighting effects at night.
