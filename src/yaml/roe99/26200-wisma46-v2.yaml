    UPDATE NightLight WISMA46

    After several months, many people ask me, why Wisma 46 Tower does not have a light when the night mode? because I do not know how to do the night lighting work? and maybe you know The Wisma46 is 3rd of my BAT building after I made the Tower of Batavia, and Batavia Tower also has no lighting before I Updated it, and why so long to update the night lighting of the Wisma46, because I love this building.... oh no, I 'm busy, that time I could not understand english, but I have the ambition to make a full Collor light on this building, and now you 'll see.... yes like this, it is my ambition into reality, although not perfect. if you look at almost all of BAT that I created has the hallmark of colored lights, because I want all the bat that I create have characteristics of lights color

    if you ready have Wisma46 before, Just replace the previeous of SC4model of wisma46, and wisma46 become lighting in all of your game!

    before it

    \-------Sorry I have problem with nitelite mode--------

    and now

    \------- don't give me any comment before you see nighlihting of wisma46 in your game!

    In order to see night lighting, you need to have the EP1 Update 1 for Rush Hour/Deluxe installed, and then afterwards install the patch specifically for the BAT nightlighting, available on the "Building Architect Tool" page on the official Maxis website. It is a separate download because it is optional. Note that you must be logged in to see the link.

    If you do not have this installed, no custom model you

    download will display any lighting effects at night.

    recommendations for a better view, use the SimFox Day n Nite Modd
