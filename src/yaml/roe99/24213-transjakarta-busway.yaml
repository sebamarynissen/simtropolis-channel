    Transjakarta Buscity

    TransJakarta is a bus rapid transit system in Jakarta, Indonesia. TransJakarta started on January 15, 2004 and currently has 8 corridors (or lines) in operation, 2 corridors at inactive status, and 5 corridors to be built in future. TransJakarta was designed to provide the citizens of Jakarta a fast public transportation system to help reduce rush hour traffic. The Indonesian Government provided TransJakarta buses with their own private lanes and Transjakarta's ticket prices are subsidized by the state government

    all of the three bus models are available in SC4
