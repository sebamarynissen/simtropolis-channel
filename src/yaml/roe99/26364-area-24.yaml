    Area 24 BAT Model

    This is my first BAT building, which I created a successful using 3dsmax, unfortunately I always failed when I tried to export in high quality mode, render prosses always stop when it reaches 30-40 %, sometimes my computer restarts by itself, I do not know why? maybe my computer specs are ancient, so it does not support to run programs such as 3dsmax 2010 design, was lucky when I switch to draft mode rendering eventually succeed, even the process just takes 25 minutes, rendering even a night mode, less than 15 minutes, and this is the result ! all your comments and criticisms are welcome

    night view mode is available only dark night, then in suggest you use the simfoxdaynite mod for better appearance
