    MNC Tower BAT Model

    I accidentally added a 33% height of the building to approximately 166m, so not too short when seen in the game, on glass texture I tried to follow closely the JasonCW glassing tutorial, Thank you so much to JasonCW for the tutorial It is very useful to me. I think the glass texture of the MNC tower still not perfect, but for now, I'm quite satisfied with the results. I was only difficulty when it will select images to be used as ground plane for the reflection of the glass, but I am sure the next BAT will be better.

    \---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note:

    In order to see night lighting, you need to have the EP1 Update 1 for Rush Hour/Deluxe installed, and then afterwards install the patch specifically for the BAT nightlighting, available on the "Building Architect Tool" page on the official Maxis website. It is a separate download because it is optional. Note that you must be logged in to see the link.

    If you do not have this installed, no custom model you

    download will display any lighting effects at night.

    night view is dark night mode, then in suggest you use the[SimFox Day 'n' Nite Modd 1](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/23089-simfox-day-n-nite-modd/) for better appearance
