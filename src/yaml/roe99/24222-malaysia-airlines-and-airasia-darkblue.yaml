    Thank you so much to him and also to Simfanatik who has advised and reminded me

    Installation : just unzip the dat file to your /My Documents/SimCity  4/Plugins directory

    Uninstall:

    Remove the dat file from your /My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins directory

    NOTE: You must use only one set of the aircraft addons files use the 2 Malaysia Airlines dat file or 2 AirAsiadarkblue dat file and if you have the other aircraft or plane model in the your plugin folder cut first that file to other plugin folder for backup or just delete it and then put this plane model alternately, not both to your plugin folder
