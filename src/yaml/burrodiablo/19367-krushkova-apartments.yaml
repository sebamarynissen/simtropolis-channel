  summary: Krushkova Apartments
  description: |-
    A pair of Soviet style prefab apartments. The file contains a straight and diagonal version, both Landmark and Growable. The building is based on, what I suspect to be quite common design throughout the former USSR. This partictular one is fictional but I based alot of the design on a building in Leonidovo on Sakhalin Island, the very far East of Russia.

    Sorry, theres no Night lights since this was made in 3DsMax and i'm not familiar with the night lighting technique it uses. Hopefully, that'll change by my next release
