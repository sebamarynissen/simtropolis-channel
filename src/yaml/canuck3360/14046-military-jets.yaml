    Ok nothing too special Just your standard Maxis Hanger and textures with Military Jets made by  SNZ . I have attempted many times to contact him and his site is no longer working so I must not take credit for these excellent models I have recived permission from Dirk to upload these and I'm am only doing this for a few requests that I have gotten.

    Please note the screenshot is not one that is included Its the best shot I have of one of these.
