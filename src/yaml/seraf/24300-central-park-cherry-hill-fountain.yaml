  summary: Central Park Cherry Hill Fountain
  description: |-
    This time my new bat is lovely small fountain from New York's Central Park. It's called Cherry Hill Fountain and it was designed in 1860 by one of Central Park genius creators Jacob Wrey Mould. Fountain is located on the west side of famous Bethesda Fountain and it was originally used as watering trough for horses. Small, but beautyful. Enjoy ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
