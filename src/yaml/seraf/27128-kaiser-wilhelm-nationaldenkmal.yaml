  description: |-
    Happy New Year everyone! This memorial was built in Berlin in 1895 to Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany.

    It cost a huge (then) sum of four million Marks and was one of the greatest monuments in Germany.

    While other monuments were bigger, this one was distinguished by great design and elaborate sculpture decoration.

    Sadly, the Monument was demolished in 1950 because of political motives. Hope it will be great addition to your cities. Enjoy.
