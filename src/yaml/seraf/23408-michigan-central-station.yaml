  summary: Michigan Central Station
  description: |-
    My another BAT - Michigan Central Station from Detroit. This building is an example of the great railstations era, originated with Pennsylvania Station from New York.  
    Great work of Warren and Wetmore built in 1913 fell in total disrepair, but I made a "like new" version ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)

    It's not perfect, but I did my best ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)
