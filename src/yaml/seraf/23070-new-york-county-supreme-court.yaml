  description: |-
    New York County Supreme Court - Beautiful neoclassicist building from NY, hexagonal in outline, designed by Guy Lowell. It is one of main buildings in NY civic center... ![1.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/1.gif)  Much time passed since I started making this building. Much trouble transferring the model from gmax to max and finishing it... impeded uploading it here. I managed to solve most of the problems, but some remain. ![15.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/15.gif)  Model is darker than other buildings at night, I wasn't able to fix it despite trying really hard. I hope that you will like it anyway ![1.gif](https://www.simtropolis.com/fckEditor/editor/../../forum/i/expressions/1.gif)
