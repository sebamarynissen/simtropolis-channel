  summary: Los Angeles Home Pack 1
  description: |-
    After another viewing of *L.A. Confidential*, I created a pack of four homes (and a lotted bungalow court) found all over beautiful Los Angeles, California (my home). These sprung up all over the city in the 1920s and there are a plethora of them still around today, also found in neighboring cities. I personally love them and even lotted a bungalow court (another LA favorite style of mine).

    \- Medium wealth, 1x2 lots

    \- Chicago Tileset

    \- All densities

    \- DarkNite versions only
