  summary: Retro Tower 1
  description: |-
    Inspired by a recent trip to Las Vegas and researching old Vegas architecture, this residential tower is loosely inspired by the old Sands Hotel (now demolished). Personally, I am a huge fan of mid-century architecture, including Googie style like this. I know it is not everyone's cup-of-tea ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif ":)") I am also looking at making an alternative version of this model with some Vegas-style neon lights and alternate colors than this more subdued version. I think this would make an excellent hotel tower for you fantastic Lotters out there (I am not one). Anyway, different from the French BATs I have been producing, here are the stats:

    \- Houston Tileset

    \- Medium Wealth Residential (stage 7)

    \- Medium & High Density zones

    \- Nightlighted, either MaxisNite or DarkNite\*

    \- No dependencies

    \*DarkNite version requires SimFox's DayNNite Mod

    \*This has been tested, however please let me know if you find any issues
