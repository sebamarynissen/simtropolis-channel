  summary: The Home Alone House
  description: |-
    Happy holidays, Community!

    Whipped this famous house up, inspired by the Christmas classic, *Home Alone* (1 & 2). Certain liberties were taken and as usual my lotting is sub-par, so please feel free to re-lot to your desired aesthetic.

    \- R$$$ Low, Medium, High density zones

    \- Chicago tileset

    \- No dependencies

    \- DarkNite version only
