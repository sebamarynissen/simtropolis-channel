  summary: New York Pack 1
  description: |-
    Apologies on getting these out so late - I have been working on some of these for some time. These were modeled as an attempt to fill in the gaps of some NYC-based content. I will be adding to this set as well. Mirror-versions of all corner lots, residential and commercial alike.

    \*DarkNite versions only

    Enjoy!
