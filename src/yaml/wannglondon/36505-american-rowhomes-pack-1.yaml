  summary: American Rowhomes Pack 1
  description: |-
    Hello Community! Here are some old rowhomes I created which were uploaded to the LEX and I never uploaded them here. There are also some in this pack that have never been uploaded before. These are based on the pretty rowhomes found in Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia.

    \- Medium & High Wealth residential 1x2 lots

    \- DarkNite versions only

    \- Townhomes 3 were included in the New York pack upload
