  description: |-
    Began as a test and I actually became satisfied with the results. Absolutely horrendous lotting on my part, so please feel free to re-lot with the PIM/Lot Editor. Functions as a park stadium in-game. Also, I readjusted the LODs in the PIM so the shadows are off, but it you re-lot as-is, the shadows should show properly. Sits on a 6x6 lot size.
