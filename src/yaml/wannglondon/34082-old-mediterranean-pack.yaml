  summary: Old Mediterranean Pack
  description: |-
    My first-ever creations & upload, a set of old French Riviera inspired 1x1 lots. Loosely based on those found in Menton, France.

    These come in a varying range of colors and are w2w.

    \- Medium Wealth Residential (mix of stage 5 & 6)

    \- One Medium Wealth Commercial Service lot

    \- Euro Tileset

    \- Medium & High Density zones

    \- No dependencies

    \- No nightlighting (this may be updated)

    \*These have been tested, however please let me know if you encounter any issues
