  summary: Apartments 2
  description: |-
    LA has its fair share of chateau-inspired architecture and during a recent outing these style of apartment buildings really inspired me. I have created two versions; one with and one without the rooftop sign (very common here in Los Angeles).

    \- Stage 6 R$$$

    \- Chicago tileset

    \- 2x3 lots

    \- DarkNite versions only

    \- No dependencies
