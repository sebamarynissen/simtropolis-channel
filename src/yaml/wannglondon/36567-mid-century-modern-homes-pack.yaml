  summary: Mid Century Modern Homes Pack
  description: |-
    After a recent trip to Palm Springs, I became re-inspired by mid century architecture and whipped these up. Straight out of the Racquet Club tract and complete with breeze blocks, geometric shapes, and rugged stone walls!

    \- Stage 3 R$$

    \- Houston tileset

    \- 2x2 lots

    \- DarkNite versions only

    And I did finally use a dependency on these lots, Barocco Hispano's trees [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34720-agc-environment-dlc/). Thanks, mate!

    Feel free to re-lot as desired as I am not a very great lotter.
