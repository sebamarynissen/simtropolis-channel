    COMPASS BANK BUILDING

    The Compass Bank Building is an 18-story highrise located at 505 Marquette Avenue NW in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico.
    The building consists of a twelve-story office block sitting on top of a six-story base containing a parking garage.

    The Compass Bank Building was completed in 1968 and was originally called the National Building. At that time it was the tallest building the state in New Mexico.
