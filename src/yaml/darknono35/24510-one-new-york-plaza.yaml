    One New York Plaza is an office building in New York City, built in 1969, and is located at the intersection of South and Whitehall Streets.
    The building was renovated in 1994, and repainted from a dark Black/Grey Color scheme to a lighter White/Light Grey color.
    Today One New York Plaza stands as one of the more prominent buildings of Lower Manhattan, being the most Southern Skyscraper on Manhattan Island.

    History:
    On August 1970, the building suffered a fire in which two people were killed and 35 injured.
    The deaths were caused after an occupied elevator was "summoned" to the burning floor when one of the thermally-activated call buttons - designed to
    react to a warm finger tapping it - reacted instead to the heat of the fire on that floor.
