    The Olympic tower or 641 Fifth Ave, is a 51 story building hight of 189 meters.

    The planned use of the building was a groundbreaking concept at that time because it was th,e first mixed use zoned for Fifth Avenue, which had 21 floors of offices, 30 of condominiums and high-end retail on the first floor.

    The NBA offices are located in the tower between the 14th and 20th floors. But for the game, I've created an MLB shop in the corner on the fifth Ave and the 51st street for the Yankees and Mets.
