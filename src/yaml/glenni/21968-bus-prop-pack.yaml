  summary: Bus Prop Pack
  description: |-
    Howdy Ho, here's some models i originally made for to be modded into automata ( yeah the things that drive arround) But hey, people ask me to also release them as props, os without further ado, here's them props, very useful for lotting and all, i might use them as a dependency, but probably not, unless i release some bus related BATs.

    All models were made by me, textures by me, and it took me ages to make all these models, so you better appreciate them:p The Blue sc4 citybuses there are jsut there for reference and comparison.

    if it aint your cup of tea, then just pass, see it's that easy:p
