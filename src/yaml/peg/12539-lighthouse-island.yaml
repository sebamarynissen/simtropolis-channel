  summary: Lighthouse Island
  description: |-
    The sea air... the salt spray... waves crashing on the rocks while seagulls screech overhead as they circle in search of crabs scurrying amongst the rocks. Occasionally, the mighty fog horn sounds its great and mournful blast.

    Gawd, I just made myself hungry for Clam Chowder!! Okay, who's got the Oyster Crackers?

    This classic New England style lighthouse sits atop a rock island that you can plop anywhere in the water. Its self-leveling so you don't need to worry about water depth or altering the terrain in any way. It is also fully self-powered via a newly developed method so it does not have to be plopped near shore in order for the rotating light beacon to function.

    This version of the Lighthouse functions like the game's default lighthouse in all regards, including plop & maintenance costs. It is a Reward, but it is not conditional. You do not need  to have a seaport for it to become available. This will allow you to also use it in non-industrial cities where a seaport would be useless.

    This version of the Lighthouse also does not replace the game's default lighthouse. The primary reason for this is that the default lighthouse is land-based... and this version obviously is not. A forced replacement could cause issues when upgrading. With separate versions, you can continue to enjoy the default lighthouse or any replacement for it you have installed... or reclaim the land it occupies and replace it with this water-based version at your leisure.
