  description: |-
    Pegasus Productions has finally decided to join the farming craze with this initial offering of a tranquil poultry farm for your rural and agricultural regions. The classic Victorian style ranch house graces the 3x3 lot which abounds with plenty of aggie charm in a down-home country setting.

    And if you are buying any of this tripe, I've got some prime swampland to sell you... and I'll even toss in the Brooklyn Bridge. "**The**" Chicken Ranch, made world-famous by the hit movie, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, is a Texas institution that dates back to the early 1900s. Although illegal, a beneficial relationship between "the lady of the house" and local law enforcement allowed The Chicken Ranch to operate continuously until the 1970s. Throughout its years of operation, countless criminals were apprehended from tips provided by the staff to local law enforcement. Always a "high class joint", the Ranch's patrons and frequent visitors included many of Texas' upright & respected citizens, including judges and state Governors.

    The house on the lot is modeled after the house that was used to film the movie. There are ploppable farm & growable versions included... each with a handful of Industrial Agriculture jobs... and it actually does have chickens and a chicken coop. If you keep a close eye out, you may even see Burt & Dolly come out from time to time to say Howdy!

    The lots feature a custom query and custom sound effects... and are BTE Sleeze Reward enabled. Both ploppable and growable lots are also transit enabled and generate kickbacks... er, income. The lots use the PEG Seasonal Trees which requires that the PEG Seasonal Woods be installed. All other props are included in an included resource file.

    Well, everyday around this time the party is just getting stated down at The Ranch. So git 'er installed, and head on over for some fun & frolicin'. Can y'all say,  **"YEE HAW"** ?  Sure ya can...

    \*\* Special thanks & recognition to BarbyW who co-authored the growable version of this lot. Her expertise with growables and agricultural lots was absolutely invaluable.

    **The Chicken Ranch requires the [PEG Seasonal Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4515-peg-seasonal-woods-v206b/)** **to  be installed.**
