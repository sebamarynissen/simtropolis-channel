  summary: CDK-OWW SV Food Court Plazas
  description: |-
    These **Food Court Plazas** will add a festive splash of color to your cities as well as provide your Sims with a much appreciated place to park their butts while grabbing a quick bite or just hanging out with friends. They were designed for use with the Seaport Village, but can be used anywhere you would place a normal plaza. In fact, they work so well on their own that they have been placed in your Park Menu next to the game's default plazas.

    There are 3 Food Courts included; small (1x1), medium (2x2) and large (3x3). Each Food Court has properties that are identical to the corresponding sized default plaza.  The 1x1 Food Court has the "L" shaped planter on one side only and can be used to create larger Food Courts or custom snack and picnic areas.

    **Dependencies: None.**
