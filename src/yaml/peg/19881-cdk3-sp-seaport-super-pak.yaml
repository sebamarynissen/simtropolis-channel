  summary: CDK3 SP SEAPORT SUPER PAK
  description: |-
    This is a compilation of the primary CDK3\-SP Seaport dependency files. If you already have the dependency files listed below, this SUPER PAK is not mandatory to support the currwent CDK3\-SP lots. However, the SUPER PAK  also contains a lot of new material used in many new lots & will be listed as the primary dependency for all futher CDK3\-SP material. To avoid missing dependency issues, you should install this SUPER PACK and, for optimum performance, remove the dependency files it replaces listed below.I

    This SUPER PAK replaces the following CDK3 dependency files:

    > 1\. CDK3\-SP Container Seaport (PEG\-CDK3\_Seaport\_RESOURCE.dat )

    2\. CDK3\-SP Row Warehouses\* (PEG\-CDK3\-SP\_RowWarehouses\_101.dat )

    Once the CDK3\-SP SEAPORT SUPER PACK is installed, you can safely remove the files listed above.

    IMPORTANT: The original CDK3\-SP Row Warehouses file contained lots as well as dependency data. That dependency data only has been moved into the CDK3\-SP SEAPORT SUPER PAK. The lot data only has been repackaged into a new file (version 1.10) which is included with this download. If you remove the original CDK3\-SP Row Warehouses file, you should move the new version ( PEG\-CDK3\-SP\_RowWarehouses\_110.dat ) into the CDK3/SEAPORT/Row Warehouses folder.

    **\*\*This dependency has no dependencies**
