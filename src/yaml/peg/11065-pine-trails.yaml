#   description: |-
#     The PEG Pine Trails completes the set Trail Parks. These are a direct replacement for the original Country Roads trail parks... and feature dirt paths that are designed to wind through the PEG Pine Forests.

#     This style also uses textures for the paths instead of BAT models.. so they are slope-conforming. The logs outlining the paths are BAT models. They are visible when plopping and serve as a visual guide to  proper lot orientation.
