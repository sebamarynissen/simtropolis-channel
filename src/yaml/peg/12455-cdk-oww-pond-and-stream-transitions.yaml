  summary: CDK-OWW Pond and Stream Transitions
  description: |-
    What do you get if you toss the Pond Kit, the Stream Kit & the CDK into a paint mixer and let it run for an hour? Well, initially you get something that looks like a horrible Star Trek transporter accident !!

    But if you let that mixer run and extra hour or two, you eventually wind up with a viable means of transitioning the PEG Ponds & PEG Streams into the game's oceans... via the CDK. Adding the CDK in this fashion serves to mask a multitude of potential graphic sins & bugs inherent anytime props and textures go into the water. We will continue to pursue a non-CDK solution as well... but for those anxious to run their pond rivers and streams down to the sea, you now have a means to make it happen.

    Included are 4 new lots; a single CDK Stream lot and 3 CDK Pond lots (left, right & center). Streams are limited to a single tile in width but rivers made from the Pond Kit can be a wide as you want.

    These are CDK\-OWW (Old Wooden Waterfront) lots and plop just like any other 2-tile deep CDK lot. They will appear  in the Water Transportation menu along with the other CDK\-OWW lots. Like most CDK lots, they have pricing & properties similar to a small plaza.

    To accommodate the fact that 92.3% of all CDK lots have a road running along their inland side, conditioned with the fact that 63.7% of all statistics are made up on the spot... these lots also have an appropriate Bridge-End modeled into their inland side. This will allow you to seamlessly continue any street/road/avenue you have running along your waterfronts.

    The transition lots are packaged into separate files; one for the Streams and one for the Ponds. After installing, you can easily remove one or the other if you do not use either the Ponds or the Streams.

    **\*\***These lots require the installation of the PEG CDK\-OWW Development Kit Volume 1**.**  
     Additionally, you should also have the Deluxe Editions of the PEG Pond & PEG Stream kits installed.

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
