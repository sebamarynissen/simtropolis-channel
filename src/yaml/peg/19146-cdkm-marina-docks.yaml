  summary: A 4x wide lot adds a new lower floating dock section to your Marina.
  description: |-
    Now that you have your Marina just the way you want it... we're gonna screw it up by offering a new section you just gotta have. The Marina Docks section is just that... docks!  This 4x wide lot adds a new and different lower floating dock section to your Marina. so you can expand your Marina complex ever wider.

    The lot also features a large Boardwalk plaza area that includes 2 randomly generated buildings on either side which, of course, offer local jobs. With each plop of the lot, 2 of 4 small buildings (a restroom, a gift shop and 2 bars) will appear on the plaza. The randomness of the buildings should allow the lot to be plopped numerous times without appearing too repeatitive.

    The lot is Christmas Enabled... and offers a custom query featuring completely meaningless boater-related  stats. Its fully compatible with all CDKM lots. Poperties are similar to other CDKM lots with jobs but with the landmark & parks values reduced by half... and priced accordingly.
