  summary: RR Whistle Stop
  description: |-
    The PEGPROD Trackside Series continues with this tranquil little setting that was once a common sight along rural railroad routes. **The Whistle Stop** brings back the feel and sound of the Golden Age of Steam.

    These small, trackside servicing facilities were usually in very remote areas. They often also served as an informal depot for local residents. As the train approached, the engineer would sound the train's whistle (thus the name) to let the local folk know that if they had mail, freight or needed to hitch a ride, they better come runnin'.

    This 2x1 lot features a small coaling tower and a classic old railroad water tower built from the blueprints of a common design that was widely used throughout America. In the game, from a transportation stand-point, the lot is merely eye-candy. However, the water tower is functional and provides a bit over half of the water produced by the game's normal water tower. Although you will need to connect pipe to it to use it as a water source, it is completely independent of your city's normal water supply and will not show up in the budget. There are also no usage or production stats for it. Like the real article, you'll know its running dry when you open the tap and nothing comes out but dust.
