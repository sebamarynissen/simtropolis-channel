  summary: Ore Cars Prop Pack
  description: |-
    The PEG Ore Car Pack contains 2 variations (classic railroad red & rusty gray) of an older style metal railroad ore car that was in common use throughout North America and many other areas. There are 2 versions of each car; loaded and empty. These are not static props. They are designed to simulate activity by randomly appearing & disappearing throughout the day, as well as changing from empty to loaded. Placing several of these on a rail siding will accurately simulate an active mining or bulk product rail activity. The cars tend to be more empty in the early hours of the day and fill up as the day progresses. Most will disappear in the late evening hours and return again the next morning. The easiest way to use these in your lot development is to use the two prop families they are assigned to. Please see the Developer Notes in the Readme file for details.
