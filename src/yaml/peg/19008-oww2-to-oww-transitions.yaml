  summary: Two lots to transition from the older OWW lots to the newer OWW2 lots.
  description: |-
    This package contains 2 **OWW2** lots that allow smooth transitions to the older OWW styled lots which were wider and use a different decking texture. Included are a left-side and a right-side transition lot.

    Both lots are 2x3 in size and fully OWW2 compliant. Most properties are similar to the OWW2 1x Plaza lot.

    \* As these lots would only be used by those who also use the older OWW set, these lots are positioned in the Water Transportation menu along with the older OWW lots... and use the older OWW style of icons.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading The Official CDK Tutorial.

    **\*\* This lot requires the following dependencies**

     PEG\-CDKM Marina  
     PEG\-OWW2 Resource Pack 1
