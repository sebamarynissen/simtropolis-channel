  summary: MTP Rural Roadways Mod
  description: |-
    Add a new and more rustic/rural look to your cities with the Rural Roadways Mod. Designed for use with the MTP but certainly useful in any city where you'd rather have a slightly less developed look, this mod changes the appearance of your streets and roads in several ways.

    For starters, all sidewalks are removed and replaced with dirt edges or shoulders. In place of the wealth/density generated colored sidewalks & grassy parkways, the streets and roads themselves now change to match the surrounding wealth. Intersections change from having simple stop lines in non-developed and low density areas... to having crosswalks in medium wealth/density zones... and brick in-laid crosswalks in the upscale areas.

    For the streets, you now have three options to choose from for the lowest wealth/density zones which include the streets around farmlands. You have the choice of asphalt streets,  gravel roads or dirt roads. Again, these are only in the lowest wealth/density zones so the normal asphalt streets will still appear in normally developed areas. Its almost like adding a new street/road type.

    The mod is broken down into several files so you can easily choose which features you want installed. Streets and roads are broken down into 2 basic files so you can install either one... or both. For both the road & street mods, there are separate & optional "No Text" mods which removes the "STOP" text from the intersections. Obviously, if you live in a Spanish speaking country you would prefer to have El Stoppo or whatever the Spanish word for 'stop' is. In France, "Ceasez-Vous" might be preferable... although a tad hard to squeeze into the limited space. The No-Text mod simply removes the text... the next best thing.

    For the streets, the default mod uses asphalt streets in all wealth & density zones. The optional Dirt & Gravel mods change only the type of street used in undeveloped, low wealth/density & farmland zones. The Dirt streets really look great in and around farms but have a more abrupt transition to paved surfaces. The Gravel roads blend well with all other roadway types and work best in areas where the road surface type changes frequently.

    \* For optimum effect, it is recommended that the *RoadsNoGrass.dat file from the* **Swamper77** [Street and Road Sidewalk Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11674-street-and-road-sidewalk-mod/) also be installed. Swamper's mod will remove the sidewalks from the diagonal road tiles... which the Rural Roadways mod does not cover.

    **\*\* This mod has no dependencies.**
