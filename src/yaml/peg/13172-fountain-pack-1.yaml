  summary: Fountain Pack 1
  description: |-
    Back by popular demand (for some reason)... these old legacy fountains have been dusted off and cleaned up just enough to make them look exactly like the originals which, of course... they are. These four fountains are pre-BAT, texture-based 1x1 Lots with the same properties and costs of a small plaza. They will appear in your Parks menu somewhere around the game's default small plaza.

    The Brown Brick Fountain is designed to blend seamlessly with the popular brown brick plaza texture while the two Red Brick designs blend with the red brick "California Plaza" style texture. The Natural Rock fountain looks good in almost any setting. Of course, they can be used by themselves or mixed in with any other plaza textures.

    **\*\*These lots have No External Dependencies.**
