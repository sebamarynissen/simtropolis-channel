  summary: This initial lot is the replacement for the in-game Marina and the centerpiece of your new Marina complex.
  description: |-
    At long last, the CDK delivers a functional replacement for the game-default Marina lot. In fact, we've taken it a several steps further with a fully modular, multi-lot Recreational Marina CDK.

    This initial lot in the kit is the replacement for the game-default Marina and the centerpiece of your new Marina complex. It has all the same costs & rewards of the game's marina except that it is a tad easier to earn. Its nite-lited, transit-enabled and features floating docks and boats that extend well out into the water. And as a CDK lot, it plops even with the ocean surface every time so there is no more fussing with terrain height to keep the dock from plunging underwater.

    The new Marina reward is one of 4 marina lots in the initial release... with many more associated lots to come. All the lots are modular and designed to easily fit together to form a single large Marina complex. On the water side, all lots have a fixed upper dock/boardwalk and lower floating docks that align with each other to form continuous docks. At the rear, each lot has custom parking lots designed to form a continuous and realistic parking area along the length of the Marina complex.

    Each of the four initial Marina lots will be released separately so you can easily install only the lots you want. The other three lots will have this Marina lot as a dependency but the Marina lot itself is fully self-contained.

    \* All custom models and props used in these lots have been optimized for reduced file size and game resource usage.
