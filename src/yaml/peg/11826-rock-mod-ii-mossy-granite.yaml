  summary: ROCK MOD II Mossy Granite
  description: |-
    This is one of the newer series of Rock Mods that use an improved development process and are more photo-realistic. As with the original Rock Mods, you now can choose a rock terrain that is more appropriate for your region. Transform the appearance of your entire region with the simple install of a single DAT file.  
      
    This install contains the single **Mossy Granite** rock style which can be  used as almost any type of gray colored igneous rock. The bits of moss would make it more suitable for moist climates. This style will be installed in a separate folder in your Plugins folder by default. I suggest that you simply drag that folder to your desktop or some other location and then drag the .DAT file back into your Plugins folder while you sample it.

    **REMEMBER...** Only one style can be installed at a time... including any style installed from a previous Rock Mod pack.

    Each mod contains new texture files that overwrite the game's default rock textures. You can return to using the default textures at any time by simply removing the DAT file from your Plugins folder.  
      
    \* Some textures work better with smoother terrain while others are better for terrain with more jagged & sharper edges. Also, some look best when zoomed-in while others appear more natural when zoomed out. You will want to experiment and decide which style is best for you and the way you play your game.
