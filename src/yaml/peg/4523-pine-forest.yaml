  summary: Pine Forest
  description: |-
    Very similar to the [PEG Random Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4526-peg-random-woods-v206/) lots, the Pine Forest collection focuses on a look more suitable for mountain areas and higher elevations.

    It also uses new BAT modeled trees for greater realism than provided by the in-game trees. Like the Random Woods lots, the Pine Forest includes multiple styles with a 1x1 & 2x2 lot for each style.

    In addition to the fully textured ground and transparent ground styles, a third semi-transparent style is included. The semi transparent style is easily the best looking and most flexible to use... but is effected by the game's graphics overlay bug. It is included only for those players who are willing to deal with this issue. (see Developers Notes Below)

    The Pine Forest is PEG tested & Tree-Hugger approved. Each lot has properties similar to a small green park with slightly improved air pollution qualities.

    These lots are also 'Slope Conforming' so you can place them almost anywhere.
