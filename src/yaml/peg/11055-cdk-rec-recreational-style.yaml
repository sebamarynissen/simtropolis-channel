  summary: CDK-REC Recreational Style
  description: |-
    The CDK is back with several enhancements and some pretty cool night lighting. Modified from the original 'Highwall' style, this will be the only recreational style of CDK lots. The industrial style  and a new commercial style will be soon to follow.

    The CDK lots are connectable and self-leveling, and contain BAT foundations and props. They will alter the surrounding terrain to assure "a good Plop" (almost) every time.

    Added to this style is a new parking lot... lot. The Snack Bar also now provides jobs as well some income. Gone are the old default streetlights & generic trees. In their place are lighted trees, landscape lighting and new lamp posts with extra lighting effects. Night time on the CDK is a sight to behold.

    This style contains eight CDK lots that will allow you to fully develop your coastal areas. Although each lot (except the Snack Bar) is a park, they will now appear in your Water Transportation menu for easier access. Its time to give the Parks Menu a rest.

    \* The PEG Leveler Tool was designed specifically to level coastal areas for use with these lots.

    \*\* Existing Highwall-style CDK lots must be removed from you cities before installing the new CDK.
