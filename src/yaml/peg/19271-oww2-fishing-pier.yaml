  description: |-
    This ploppable CS$$ **OWW2** lot adds an extra bit of realism along your Boardwalks by depicting a common sight along most real-world developed coastlines.  Fishermen!!

    The Fisherman Pier lot includes a short fishing pier and a small complex of related shops that provides almost everything your Sim Anglers could need to enjoy a relaxing day of coastal fishing. Its all there... the prerequisite giftshop, the bait & tackle store and, of course, the bar where tales of the one that got away get longer & bigger with each round.

    This 3x3 ploppable is a CS$$ lot with about 25 or so jobs. It features a central transit-enabled driveway for more realistic connections to adjacent roads... and uses new upgraded parking lot textures for added realism.

    \* As the lot provides jobs, it must have road access.

    The lot is compatible with all OWW2 collections and is extensively nite lited. It also features a custom query with unique stats driven by conditions within your city.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading The Official CDK Tutorial.
