  summary: Fort Pegasus
  description: |-
    Fort Pegasus is an Historic Landmark that calls to an older era when the land was young and settlers were trekking ever westward in search of a better life.

    Forts such as this, carved from the very elements of the frontier, provided sanctuary to settlers and often served as a center of commerce for the communities that sprung up around them. Due to its historic nature, exquisite preservation and daily guided tours, this landmark also serves as a museum with the appropriate scholastic EQ boost in the surrounding area.

    Its a popular locale for family holidays and educational field trips.

    To avoid educational capacity problems, the fort has been converted to a true museum lot... with jobs. It no longer is a landmark in the technical sense. The custom UI now shows the standard museum data and funding control.
