  summary: Observation Tower
  description: |-
    For those of us who think we're above it all... or would like to be... PEG Productions proudly presents... the Observation Tower. Modified from a public domain mesh, this new tower is designed for use with the PEG Random Woods, Pine Forest & Seasonal Woods packages. Situated on a 2x2 lot and nestled between the appropriate tree types, this tower can be used as a fire watch tower, a bird watching platform, or a deer blind for those of you who are compelled to pop a cap upside Bambi's head.

    The lot has the same park-like properties as a 2x2 Forest/Woods lot. For each style, there are textured and transparent ground versions. (6 lots in total) Each lot has been sanctioned by the NTHA (National Tree Huggers Association)... a non-profit and totally fictional organization.
