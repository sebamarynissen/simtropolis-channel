  summary: One of the more popular amusements along the Boardwalk.
  description: |-
    Captain Nemo's Wild Ride is one of the more popular amusements along the Boardwalk. Passengers are treated to a fantasy voyage\* aboard the Nautilus... an operational submarine that is loosely based on the Jules Verne classic... with a little Beatles tossed in for color. During the 20 minute voyage, passengers are guided past a nearby reef with plenty of colorful sea life and, of course, subjected to an attack by a giant mechanic squid.

    *\*Fantasy voyage not included. Optional imagination required .*

    The lot is a 3x3 CS$$ ploppable with jobs. It is fully OWW2 compatible with a boardwalk and parking that align with adjacent OWW2 lots. The lot is transit enabled with a central driveway for a more realistic network connection.

    The lot is compatible with all OWW2 collections and is extensively nite lited. It also features a custom query with unique stats driven by conditions within your city. The query also uses 3 custom musical sound effects that are different each time the lot is queried.

    \* As the lot provides jobs, it must have road access.
