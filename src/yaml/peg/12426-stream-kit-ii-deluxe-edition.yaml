  summary: Stream Kit  Deluxe Edition
  description: |-
    ... and to compliment your shiny new Ponds, Pegasus Productions does the "ditto" thing with this **Deluxe Edition** of **The Stream Kit**.

    Improvements in the Deluxe Edition include:

    1\. **NO SEAMS!!**  Again... those pesky hairline seams that appeared between many sections are now gone for good.

    2\. **Improved Slope Tolerance**. It is now possible to build a straight stream up a modest slope. Using roads to predefine & smooth your path, you can now easily wind your streams up almost any slope. And for those slopes that are just too steep, we now have...

    3\. **Improved WATERFALLS!!!** Yes... we finally engineered an improved system for making waterfalls that are easy to plop and nice to look at. Blending old & new... texture and BAT, we now have a waterfall that will flex and stretch to fit any single-tile height slope you create. Unlike the previous Stream Waterfall, the new deluxe version also includes the top, center and bottom of the falls all in a single lot. No more separate top and bottom lots to contend with.

    4\. **Open Modular Architecture**. Like the new Ponds, the new Stream Kit has also been restructured from the ground up to allow easier add-ons. This includes completely new  stream styles that you will be able to change as easily as a rock or water mod style by simply exchanging a single file.

    5\. **Reduced Costs... Reduced Effects**. The plop and maintenance costs have been reduced significantly. Accordingly, the Park & Landmark effects have been reduced as well. Although the cost and effects for each lot was fairly modest, collectively, it all could easily add up to a significant monthly expense and and an easily capped out desirability. The new reductions should make even extensive water systems affordable and viable in rural and agricultural areas.

    6\. **Transparent Texturing!!** All Stream Kit lots now have transparent textures. This allows the the streams to blend better with natural terrain and rocks mods at higher altitudes. This also allows the streams to be used with add-on terrain mods such as the snow/artic mod.

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
