  summary: RTK3 Recreational Style
  description: |-
    Curved lots in Squaresville? Oh Shirley... you jest!! Don't bother pinching yourself...you're not dreaming. With the use of an innovative, highly sophisticated process I call "mojo", you can now break up that monotonous squared look prevalent in your cities with some seductive curves!

    There have been numerous requests for rounded & curved lots... and quite a few for single-tile high wall sea walls as well. Two birds... one rock... BAM!! Most of the normal rules governing lot development were broken with this new approach. Its a bit like saying, "Screw gravity... I want to go up!"

    But the end result bears fruit. Single tile lots covering 2 or three tiles and a collection of 21 new custom BAT models all combine to make the impossible... possible. I decided to make this style the new RTK... because it plops like the RTKs. Unlike the CDK sea walls, you must level the terrain at the top of the bank for these lots to work.

    However, unlike the older RTKs, you don't need to worry about having even slopes or the water depth. Just level the Top... and Plop!! You can even control how high the walls are by raising or lowering the level of the lot above the water. New in Version 2.05: The repetitive gazebos on every outer corner have been replaced with a random prop family to add some variety. Every outer corner will now have either the gazebo or 1 of 3 new statue props.
