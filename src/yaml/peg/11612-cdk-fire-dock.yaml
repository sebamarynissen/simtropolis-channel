  summary: CDK Fire Dock
  description: |-
    Adding value and function to the PEG CDK, this new waterfront Fire Station will provide fire protection for your city on land as well as at sea. With all the properties of a large fire station, this fully functional fire station covers a large area and has two fire engines that can be dispatched to fires.

    Also serving as the home port for the SimCity Fire Department's historic fire boat S.C.F.D Tinkle... ... ...named after famous fire fighter John Tinkle, of course... this fire station continues the proud & historic tradition of going down to the sea with some really bad-ass fire fighting equipment!

    This fire station was designed for use with the CDK Industrial style but works well with the Recreational style as well. It occupies a 5x2 sized lot, is transit enabled, and provides jobs in the same manner as other fire stations.

    This lot has no external dependencies.
