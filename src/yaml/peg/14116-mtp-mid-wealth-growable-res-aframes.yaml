  summary: MTP Mid Wealth Growable RES AFrames
  description: |-
    This second offering of mountain-specific, growable RES lots for the **MTP** features 4 variations of the popular A-Frame styled log cabins. There are 16 new lots in this collection... all of them Medium Wealth with varying densities that your low-wealth cabins will eventually grow into.

    These are definitely more "up-scale" than the basic log cabins... but not quite to the "we're so rich, we crap money" stage. That will come in the third release of High-Wealth growable MTP lots. But in the mean time, these are pretty nice and really add a mountain "feel" to the area.

    In order to have growable lots specific to the Mountain Theme, we have used 2x5, 3x5 & 5x5 custom lot sizes. Ordinary, game-default RES lots will not grow on custom lots of this size. The player must create custom zones of this size... which is easy to do by holding down the CTRL key while using the mouse to drag out the zone size.

    Because larger, custom lot sizes are required, several cabins are spaced out on the lot to represent several homes occupying the area. The resident values have been adjusted upwards to reflect the number of homes on each lot.

    Additionally, these lots are designed to accommodate the sloped terrain of mountainous areas. The cabin models are designed with extended foundations that merge into sloped terrain.... so instead of a building on top of a concrete block, you get cabins that merge realistically into the  hillside. These a-frame cabins also feature elevated decks supported by pilings that adjust to almost any degree of slope.

    The lots use random building & prop families so the cabins will always be different on each lot. The cabins also use the  new  Random Smoke feature... so you will see smoke coming from their chimneys at different times of the day.

    *\* The MTP Growable RES lots are part of a much larger & expanding theme. These are not just simple "install and hope they grow" lots.  These lots are part of a full-cycle residential community spanning all density types... that will grow and update into newer, wealthier versions of themselves.*

    *They are not intended to supplement the existing array of residential RCI lots. They are designed to fully replace them.. but only in areas or cities controlled by the player via use of custom zoning sizes. In this way, they will not affect normal/default RES lots & development zoned in normal & conventional sizes.*

    **\*\* This lot requires the following dependencies:**
