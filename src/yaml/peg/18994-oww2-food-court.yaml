  summary: Extending out over the water, your sims can enjoy great views whilst getting a bite to eat.
  description: |-
    This 3x3 section of the OWW2 boardwalks extends out over the water and provides an ideal & picturesque pier area for a popular and bustling Food Court. Several shops provide a large variety of tasty snacks... including Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Fish & Chips and, of course, the ever-popular Smelt-on-a-Stick TM.

    The lot is a ploppable CS$$ providing jobs and income from taxes. The lot building is a prototype that incorporates several new development techniques in that the building is elevated, located fully out over the water, and is a multi-part collection of 13 non-connected structures... combined into one lot building. (ie.. 39 LODs)

    The lot is compatible with all OWW2 collections, is extensively nite lited and Christmas Enabled. The driveway entrance is transit enabled for a more realistic connection. The lot uses a custom query with unique stats driven by conditions within your city.

    In addition to the normal properties associated with a CS$$ lot, the Food Court has some YIMBY effects comparative to other larger OWW2 lots.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading The Official CDK Tutorial.
