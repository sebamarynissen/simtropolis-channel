  summary: MTP Mountain Trails REC Pack 1
  description: |-
    New... for the **PEG Mountain Trails**... this Recreation Pack adds seven new Mountain Trail lots to your off-road toy box. Included is almost everything you would need to create you very own, custom camp grounds. This pack is loaded with many new custom props that will breathe new life into those old dusty trails. Many props shuffle and change to create an active camp ground look while still maintaining that peaceful, easy feeling.

    The seven new lots are:

    **1\. Mountain Trail Tunnel Lot.**
    By request... this 1x1 lot allows you to visually extend your trails through mountains. Can also be used as a small mine.

    **2\. Mountain Trail Corner Picnic Area.**
    A 1x1 variation of the standard corner section. The dirt area on this one has been widened to make room for a couple of wooden picnic tables.

    **3\. Mountain Trail Ranger Station.**
    We re-used the game's Ranger Station prop on this 2x2 lot because... well, because is doesn't suck. With integrated Mountain Trails, this lot looks great as part of a larger camp ground or just about anywhere along the trail.

    **4\.** **Mountain** **Trail Camp Site.**
    A 1x1 individual camp site lot that plugs in to any trail piece. Used with Tees and 4-ways, you can easily create large camp grounds of almost any design. Each lot displays random tents that are packed up each day as the campers head on down the trail. New tents appear as new campers hike in for the night. And, of course, each camp site has a toasty camp fire each night for cooking up those tasty Smores.  Anymore know the second verse to 'Kumbaya'?

    **5\. Mountain Trail Recreation Area**.
    A common fixture at larger campsites, this 2x3 Recreation Area features a large above-ground pool, BBQ pits and plenty of space and toys to keep the kiddies busy. With a large patio area and covered tables, this would be the main focal point and social spot of most camp grounds.

    **6\. Mountain Trail General Store & Trading Post**
    Many large camp grounds have one... in one form or another. Many also serve as the official headquarters or office for the camp ground. Loaded with the usual over-priced groceries, beer, bug spray, beer, camping supplies, bait & beer... many also have a small grill area and serve food to campers who's idea of "roughing it" means 'no cable'.

    **7\. Roadside General Store & Trading Post  (w/ Jobs)**
    A variation of the Pine Trail store, this one is designed to plop along your road network. Transit enabled and offering jobs, it also includes Mountain Trails and works well as an entrance to a campground or as a trail head.

    **\*\* This lot requires the following dependencies:
