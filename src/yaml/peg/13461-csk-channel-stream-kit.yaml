  summary: CSK - Channel Stream Kit
  description: |-
    Now you can extend your Streams with a more Urban look with this 'channelized' add-on for the PEG Stream Kit. Although technically an extension of the Stream Kit, these concrete lined channels evolved during development (feature creep) into their own, stand-alone mini-canal or channel system. They will merge seamlessly with the existing Streams but can also be used all by themselves. The new single tile wide Channels are a great way to have water flowing through your city without sacrificing a lot of real estate.

    With the old and stained concrete look, they are grungy enough to look right at home in even the dirtiest industrial area. Yet, with the red tile wall caps, they have that old-world charm & Mediterranean styling that adds class to any residential or commercial area. Very flexible... with 2 styles of corners (square or round), a pedestrian bridge designed for use with the PEG Trail Park **&** Seasonal Trail Park, a roadway/network bridge and an extender lot to allow passage under elevated rail or highways, these channels can go almost anywhere. They are even mildly slope-tolerant and can traverse up/down smooth, modest slopes.

    The kit also includes a Stream Transition lot for a seamless transition to & from the original Streams. Additional lots, including a waterfall and a lock, are being developed for the first add-on to the new style.

    The individual lots retain a small taste of park & landmark benefits, however, their desirability values have been greatly reduced. They still provide a taste of the YIMBY, but they won't collectively blow out any caps. Their plop price has also been reduced significantly and maintenance averages $1 a lot/tile.

    \* These lots have been relocated to the Water Transportation Menu for ease of use.

    \*\* The straight, 3x straight and straight Utility lots are slope tolerant and will allow the channels to flow down (or up) modest slopes.

    \*\*\* All the channel lots fully cover the tile(s) of the lot... so there is no concern about matching adjacent terrain.

    **\*\* The Channel Stream Kit has no dependencies.**
