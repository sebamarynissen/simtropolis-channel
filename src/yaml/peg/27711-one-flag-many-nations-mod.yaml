    **PEG One Flag Many Nations Mod**  
    **By Pegasus**  
      
    The One Flag... Many Nations mod allows Lot Developers to place a generic flag on their lots which will then display the user's specific or chosen national flag when that lot is used in their game. The player decides which flag will be displayed by installing the one modified flag .dat files enclosed in this mod.

    Players should follow the Installation instructions below very carefully. Developers can learn more as to how this mod works in the Developer's Notes section below.

    This is an updated version of the original mod and is dramatically reduced in size. To use this mod, the player must have the **Maxis Day of Peace** Add-On properly installed on their system:

    **\- [Direct Download Link](https://community.simtropolis.com/library/maxis/sc4/buildings/dayopeace.dat)**

    (Other Maxis Files can be downloaded [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/).)

    Please note that this mod merely references the flag graphic images contained in the Day of Peace Add-On. Additional flags can not be added unless created by Maxis or a 3rd party developer. If your flag isn't included and/or you prefer not to have a flag displayed on lots that use this mod, simply don't install this mod.

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here.](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**
