  summary: SKI RESORT Half Way Hut
  description: |-
    There is a top and there is a bottom... and somewhere around the half-way point in between. there is a spot that is aptly named... The Half-Way Point. And somewhere around this point is where your will find a **Half-Way Hut** on the more astute ski resorts that realize that skiers usually carry cash & credit cards when they ski.

    "Half-Way Hut" is a common reference to a rest and snack area that can be found on many larger ski resorts. These rest areas provide a convenient place for skiers to warm up by a fire, purchase extremely marked-up food and beverages, and take a break before heading back out to carve up the slopes. Some are very simple little shacks... and some are larger and fancier. Ours is one of the fancier ones.

    The **Half-Way Hut** is a 4x3 lot that can be plopped anywhere on your PEG Ski Resort. It does not require road-acess. However, it does have nitelites in the Winter mode and will require power. The resort's 1x1 skier & safety netting lots are usually all that is needed to extend power up the mountain.

    Like all Ski Resort lots, when in Winter mode, the roof is covered with snow & the lot is active with skiers. The ski racks are full by day and smoke can be seen coming from the chimney.  In Summer mode, the snow and skiers are gone. The racks are empty... and the windows are boarded up to prevent those pesky bears from ran-sacking the place.

    *\* The structure has an extended foundation and can optionally be plopped over a slope to give the appearance of having been built into the mountainside. The rear of the lot should be plopped on a row of level tiles.*

    *\* The* PEG Ski Resort *collection was designed for use with the* PEG Snow Mod*. However, the Snow Mod is not mandatory. The resort can stay open year-round at high altitude using a snow-capped terrain mod... or can optionally be used with any mod that provides a snow-covered terrain.*

    **\*\* This lot is an add-on to the**  **[PEG Ski Resort](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22995-peg-ski-resort/)** **collection which is required to use this lot.

    Installation of the**  **[PEG Snow Mod 2](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22925-peg-snow-mod-2/)** **is also recommended for full Winter effects.**
