  summary: Trail Park Fountain Plaza
  description: |-
    This large (3x3) deluxe plaza is an add-on for the [PEG Trail Parks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11001-peg-trail-parks-iii/). It can be used with both the standard Trail Parks or the [PEG Seasonal Trail Parks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11054-peg-seasonal-trail-parks-v305/) version. It can also be used stand-alone as a normal large plaza.

    It is fully self-contained (no external dependencies) with all required elements contained in the accompanying resource file. The lot has the same properties as a normal large plaza. It is Transit Enabled for pedestrians and features a custom soft waterfall background sound-effect. It will appear ion the Parks menu next to the game's default large plaza.

    **\*\*This lot has no dependencies.**
