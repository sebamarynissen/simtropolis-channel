    **Mod Description:**  
    \* Tired of your town rolling up the sidewalks at sunset? Wouldn't be nice to have a more active nightlife in your cities?

    This mod is the foundation that will be continually added to and updated as more game props are identified for 'extended viewing'. This initial version contains only modifications to the 3 Small Fountain Effect props that shut off at sunset. With this mod, they now operate 24 hours a day.

    All players and lot builders are invited to participate by identifying the game props they would like altered to be viewable 24/7 or for longer periods of time in the game. A related message topic will be started in the Lot Building forum where suggestions and ideas should be posted.

    The obvious advantages to lot builders is the time saved in not having to include customized prop exemplars in your lots where the Prop Appearance or date properties need to be adjusted. This mod can also serve as a handy common 'copy & paste file(s)' source to add custom properties to these props when included in your lots... making sure to give each one a unique IID.

    If the idea catches on, it could be very universally beneficial to all. If not, well, it didn't take very long to make.  :-)  
    **UPDATE HISTORY**  
    V1.0.5 - Original version included the 3 Small Fountain Effects, modified to be visible 24/7. They previously were visible only during daylight.

    V1.0.6 - Added the 5 bridge wash effects modified to be visible 24/7. They previously were visible only during daylight.

    **Installation Instructions:**  
    After unzipping the file, copy the .dat file to your C:/My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins folder. The effects will not be immediately apparent on exiting lots. They will have to be bulldozed and re-plopped for the new effects to be visible. However, any new development will display the new effects.
