  summary: Old West Prop Pack
  description: |-
    The PEG Old West Prop Pack contains a variety of useful props with an Old West flavor that can be used by developers. For the player, it contains no usable or ploppable material but is required as a Dependency for many other lots, including Fort Pegasus. Lots requiring this product should list it as a dependency in their descriptions and readme files.

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
