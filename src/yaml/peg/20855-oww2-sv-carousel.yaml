  summary: Sim's children are bound to love this classical attraction by the shoreline.
  description: |-
    The bell rings... the organ begins to play... and you're off to the races on a wooden pony, Try as you may, you never seem to be able to catch up to that damn horse ahead of you. Personally... I think the race is rigged.  
      
    No  Seaport Village   could ever be complete without some reason to drag along the kids. And if you have ever been on one, you'd recall the magic that makes a good, large Carousel so special... despite being a long ways away from an E-Ticket ride by today's standards.  
      
    Carousels have been large attractions at many seaside tourist traps... and now our Seaside Village has joined the club. This is a 2 tile wide, CS$$ RCI ploppable design for use with the PEG OWW2 Seaside Village series. The lot offers jobs, income from taxes, a custom query... and is extensively nite-lited. The lot also features a custom background sound effect of classic carousel organ music that can be heard whenever you are near the lot in the game.
