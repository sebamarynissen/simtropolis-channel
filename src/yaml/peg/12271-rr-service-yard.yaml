    The **PEG\-RR** Trackside Series strikes again with this highly flexible rural-styled **Railroad Service Yard**. This 8x2 lot features a fully functional, transit-enabled double-track rail running the length of the lot... as well as a single track siding for display of the eye candy. Intended for use in rural settings, it is flexible enough to fit right into your grimiest industrial zones and even the wrong-side-of-the-tracks area of suburbia.

    Don't take this the wrong way, but this lot can go both ways... either replacing your existing rail line or plopping down next to it and connected as a siding. You can even plop it on both sides of the main line, staggered or aligned,  and create larger, intricate train yards.

    But wait... that's not all. We've loaded up this lot with more eye-candy than your local Hooter's Bar & Grill. Pretty much everything's in here except the kitchen sink. No wait... I think there's one in the shed.

    For starters, a couple of local freights can be seen daily pulled off onto the siding for service while making room for the long haul main line trains. An ore train hauling ore from Big John's Mine stops by in the morning while a logging train from the nearby logging industry (in development) pulls off in the afternoons.

    Both trains are using older steam era locos that are still earning their keep.... and both of them smoke!! (Why not? It worked for Lionel !!)  Along with that we have the facilities for tending to the steam locos and a fuel bunker for the diesels... the prerequisite tool sheds and some trucks that come and go throughout the day.

    The lot is cheap to plop and free to maintain... primarily because its purely visual and serves absolutely no functional purpose. But then, that's what my wife said about me!
