  summary: Solar Collector 1
  description: |-
    Finally... solar power comes of age with this innovative solution for providing power at night time as well. While traditional solar power stations stop giving up the juice after sunset, this baby is (BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!) Still Going!!  
      
    Okay, Okay... I don't take this seriously either. But it was fun to make and actually rather fun to use. It has all the properties of a solar power plant in a small 1x2 tile lot that will fit almost anywhere. The power output is reduced correspondingly to 500MWh per month. It produces 250% more power than a windmill at double the cost... making it a realistic addition to your cities power & cost-wise.  Like an ideal girlfriend, it costs a bit less and puts out a bit more.

    The parking lot on the lot is transit enabled. You may have to manually connect it. However, like the windmills, the lot does not have to have road access.

    **\*\* This lot has no dependencies.**
