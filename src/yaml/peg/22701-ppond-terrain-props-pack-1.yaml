  summary: PPond Terrain Props Pack 1
  description: |-
    This mod adds many new Terrain props to your Mayor Flora menu that you can use for Terrain Detailing and to further enhance the look of your PPond waterways. Although they are designed to expand the collection of ploppable terrain and shore props included with the PPond Kit, these props can be used anywhere in your cities to add extra detail to your terrain. The PPond Kit is not required in order to use these ploppable props.

    **Whats Included:**

    **1\. Wild Flowers -** Four wild flower textures that can be plopped anywhere to add a splash of natural color to your terrain. Semi-transparent and easily overlayed to create small patches of flowers as thick or thin, large or small, as you want. We refer to them as Daisies, "Vandy" Lions, Prairie Rose & Poppies (white, yellow, purple & orange) but they can be any type of flowers you wish them to be.

    **2\. Grasses -** Two new grassy textures to add a little extra green to any area. Looks good down by the water or to help blend in barren rocky areas with the grassy terrain. Can be "painted" on thickly to created lush lawns or fields of grass. Comes in a lighter Grass texture and a darker Clover texture.

    **3\. Leaves -** Similar to the grassy textures... but in a shade of brown that can be used to add the look of fallen leaves and foliage in any area. Looks good under trees. Can also be used as a dirt path or to add light patches of dirt to any grassy area. Very flexible with lots of potential uses.

    **4\. Ballast -** A gravel texture designed to add the ballast along rail lines that the game forgot. In a brownish tone to match the dirt shoulders and edges of the PEG Rail textures and the MTP Road, Street & Avenue mods. Can be used to create paths or anywhere that a brownish gravel is desired.

    **5\. Rip-Rap** \- A dark, rocky texture of the type commonly seen along waterfronts, harbors and breakwaters. Can be plopped underwater. Useful for adding a "man was here" look to terrain along your coastlines.

    **6\. Sand  -** Simpy referred to as "Sand 2", this is an extra, slightly darker version of the Sand  texure included with the PPond Kit.

    **7\. Gravel  -** A texture similar to the Pebble texture, but smaller and denser.

    **8\. Weeds  -** In rotating groups of 5.. both lush green & dead brown... ranging from small to large and clumps. Ideal for adding that "natural" (ie... neglected) look to your terrain. The green weeds also double as reeds along waterways. Both groups can be "planted" in rows to simulate crops. The taller weeds look very much like corn plants.

    **9\. Dead Trees  -** A rotating collection of 5 dead trees... ranging in size from a small bush to a tall, naked pine. Also includes a large dead oak and a fallen dead pine. We sorta hate to put anything dead in our beautiful forests. But lightning sucks & trees can't duck. It happens. Get over it. And yes... when  a tree falls in the forest, it makes one Hell of a racket... no matter who's around to hear it.

    *\* The various ploppable props are grouped into separate files so you can easily remove certain groups of props if you do not want to use them.*

    *\* These files also include normal (non-ploppable) versions of the props so they can be used in the Lot Editor on your own custom lots.*

    **\*\* No dependencies.**
