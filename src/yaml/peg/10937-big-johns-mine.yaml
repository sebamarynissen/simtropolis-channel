  summary: Big Johns Mine
  description: |-
    Big John's Mine was started by a group of mine disaster survivors and named after the man who sacrificed his life to save them. Still following the original vein discovered in 1887, Big John's Mine continues to turn a tidy profit for its owners & providing jobs for local inhabitants. Sure, mining is a dirty industry but small old mines such as Big John's often spared the landscape of the scars inflicted by large pit and hydraulic mining operations.

    This lot uses the PEG Ore Car props that simulate a shuffling effect as cars generally appear early in the day, fill up, move around and often are gone after nightfall. This lot is also transit enabled for rail as well as road traffic. The UI sound effect is lengthy... an often annoying PEG trademark... but it does help set the mood.  Enjoy..
