  summary: OWW2 Resource Pack 1
  description: |-
    This is the primary dependency file for the re-styled CDK\-OWW2 (Old Wooden Waterfront) and will be required for all new CDK\-OWW lots.

    The new CDK\-OWW2 has been completely overhauled to match the new CDK Marina style of lots. These lots can be used to expand and add variety to your CDK Marina complexes... or used on their own to create attractive seawall boardwalks along your coastlines. Like the Marina lots, the CDK\-OWW2 lots are 3 tiles deep... and also have the upper dock/boardwalk and the rear parking areas that align in a modular fashion. In fact, the only differences between the two styles is that Marina lots have the lower floating docks... and higher recreational properties.

    As the new CDK\-OWW lots are 3 tiles deep, they will not directly replace the older OWW style lots which were only 2 tiles deep. Players can choose to use both old & new versions... or uninstall the older version after replacing the older lots in their cities.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading **The Official CDK Tutorial.**
