  summary: RR Rural Freight Station
  description: |-
    Our second offering in the Rural Trackside Series, the PEG Rural Freight Station is a simple freight station with a rustic look designed to match the rural passenger station.  It has the same  basic properties and costs as the game's default freight station.

    Other than visually, the primary difference with the Rural Rail Station is that it is smaller at only 2x2 tiles in size. It's transit properties have also been patched to increase efficiency by allowing rail-to-truck transition as well as truck-to-rail transition.

    The small parking lot/loading area is transit enabled. If connected to your road network, you will see freight trucks from nearby factories pull in, drive slowly by the docks as if unloading, and drive off again.
