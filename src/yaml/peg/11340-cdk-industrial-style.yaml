  summary: CDK Industrial Style
  description: |-
    This CDK Industrial style is a working Industrial waterfront that brings the look and the sounds of a busy industrial harbor to your coastlines. This set of self-leveling, connecting lots provides plenty of jobs and lots of activity as it brings your industrial coastal areas to life. These lots are also immune to the game's "water-graphics" bug that affect many other water/coastal based lots.

    All of the Industrial waterfront series lots either generate income via taxes or provide jobs. Several are Transit Enabled. Combined together, they form a busy and productive industrial waterfront that looks good while being functional. And if the water a'int your bag, these lots can be plopped on dry land and look pretty good as frontage lots for your railways.  
      
    This new CDK Industrial style has been updated to better accommodate future add-ons and has been optimized  to some degree. The previous first 2 add-ons have been combined into this single release. It can be installed over the existing version without first removing the lots in the game. In fact, the existing lots can be re-plopped at your leisure as the modifications are minimal and visually negligible.

    Lots providing jobs require road access. The Industrial style mixes lots with and without jobs. This allows you to construct a fully developed coastal area without having to run roads to every lot. You can easily intermix and fill in blank areas with industrial zoning for even greater variety.

    **\* The PEG Leveler Tool was designed specifically to level coastal areas for use with these lots.**
