  summary: A lighthouse which functions as a museum. A replica of the Thomas Point Lighthouse.
  description: |-
    This model is a replica of the Thomas Point Lighthouse which was built in 1875. It is a "screw pile" lighthouse, so called for its foundation of seven 10-inch diameter wrought-iron screw piles that are screwed 11 feet, 6 inches into the bottom of the bay.

    Although the Thomas Point Lighthouse is still operational in Chesapeake Bay, the nearly identical Drum Point Lighthouse was decommissioned years ago and moved onshore to serve as a museum and tourist attraction.

    This lot is the OWW2 version of a similar lot released for the original OWW. We "unscrewed" our original screw pile lighthouse, , modified the model to reflect its age and moved it onto a new pier foundation near the shore.  The Boardwalk was extended to allow easy access and a museum guest center and gift shop was erected to accommodate the anticipated crowds.

    The lot has all the properties, costs  & benefits of a game-default museum. It is a also a fully compatible OWW2 lot with modular boardwalks and parking lot areas that align with adjacent OWW2 lots.  The lot also features a central transit enabled  driveway for more realistic connections and uses the updated OWW2 parking lot textures included in the OWW2 Resource Pack 2.

    \*  As a museum, this lot is located in the Education Menu.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading The Official CDK Tutorial.
