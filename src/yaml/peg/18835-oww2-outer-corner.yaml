  summary: Extend your OWW2 around outer corners. You aren't limited to straight sections.
  description: |-
    The OWW2 Outer Corner lot allows you to extend your seawalls around corners. This lot is similar to the 1x Plaza in most regards &  properties, except that it is 3x3 tiles in size.  The lot uses 2 different seawall sections ... one rounded and one squre... to add to the overall variety.

    \* A patch file is available that will allow the player to force one style over the other.

    * * *

    The new CDK\-OWW2 has been completely overhauled to match the new CDK Marina style of lots. These lots can be used to expand and add variety to your CDK Marina complexes... or used on their own to create attractive seawall boardwalks along your coastlines. Like the Marina lots, the CDK\-OWW2 lots are 3 tiles deep... and also have the upper dock/boardwalk and the rear parking areas that align in a modular fashion. In fact, the only differences between the two styles is that Marina lots have the lower floating docks... and  higher  recreational properties.

    As the new CDK\-OWW lots are 3 tiles deep, they will not directly replace the older OWW style lots which were only 2 tiles deep. Players can choose to use both old & new versions... or uninstall the older version after replacing the older lots in their cities.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading **The Official CDK Tutorial.**
