  summary: Seasonal Trail Parks
  description: |-
    The PEG Seasonal Trail Parks are very similar to the normal trail parks with one major exception; seasonal trees. Where the original style of trail park was designed to blend with the [PEG Random Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4526-peg-random-woods-v206/) lots and the game's default trees... the Seasonal Trail Parks are designed to compliment the [PEG Seasonal Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4515-peg-seasonal-woods-v206b/).

    These new parks feature BAT modeled pathways that replace the old textured paths. This means that the paths now show while you are plopping the lots. This makes them much easier to use.

    \*\* There are no Plaza or Snack Bar lots included in this style as the ones from the normal Trail Parks are interchangeable with this style.
