  summary: PPond Scows
  description: |-
    This is a revised version of the CSK2 Scows Prop Pack.... and replaces that file. The Scow models have been re-scaled and re-textured to appear more weathered. They have also been modified to use considerably less resources.

    Once this file is installed and the old file is removed, all scows already in your cities will be updated automatically. There is no need to replop any lots.

    *\* The Scows appear in several PPond Canal lots... and can be used with the PPond ploppable water as well.*

    **\*\* No Dependencies.**

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
