  summary: CDK-OWW SV Random Shops
  description: |-
    Our first add-on pack for the **PEG CDK Seaport Village** allows you to add more shops along the waterfront and expand your seaside commercial village to almost any size you want. The 1x wide lot randomly features one of 4 different Seaport Village styled shops that can be used stand alone or with other Seaport Village lots. For added versatility, these shops are two sided with storefronts front & rear... the waterfront on the front side and a plaza at the rear.

    But wait... that's not all!!  Not only are the buildings random... but so are the business' and shops that occupy them. With a new random code routine, the shop names and description randomly change when the lot is queried. This sucker's so random we couldn't nail it down with a box of 16 pennies and maul!!

    Still not enough? How 'bout if we throw in four extra lots which fixed versions of the 4 shops? The names and descriptions will still change but you can choose the shop type to plop for more direct control when creating your village.

    You still want more? Man, yer tough!  Okay... how 'bout if we make them so they can be plopped together seamlessly to form larger shopping structures of any size? That's right! A build-your-own nautical shopping center as large as you want. Mix and match the shops, pack them together to form long shopping strips or break them apart to allow plenty of pedestrian access. The choice is yours... build it anyway you want!!

    More? (sigh) Oh, get real!  Okay.. our final offer. If you haven't noticed from the pics above, these puppies can also be used with the PEG Pond & Stream Kits!!  That's right, Kiddo... if the sea ain't your bag or your city is landlocked, no problem!!. Build your village along a PEG river or lake or just add some streams & ponds along the village to give it that nautical theme. Just 'cause yer a land lubber doesn't mean that you should miss out on the fun.

    Okay, so we got the Seaport Village Random Shop lot, with random shop names & descriptions, plus the 4 selectable shop lots, seamless collective modular plopping, and versatile ocean or inland PEG Pond plop capability... and, oh yeah, each shop employs up to 24 local folk and provides income from taxes. All for the low, low single payment price of one simple download!
