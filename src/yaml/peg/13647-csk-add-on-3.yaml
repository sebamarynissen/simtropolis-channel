  description: |-
    We continue our **Channel Stream Kit** series with this latest add-on subtitled... **Go With the Flow**. This is a collection of 3 specialty waterfalls to add more variety & glitz to your channel systems while offering more options to allow them to flow down your city's terrain.

    The **Standard Spillway** is very similar to the Stream Kit's original non-texture based waterfall and plops just like the CSK Lock & Waterfall lots. The Spillway is 3 tiles long and self adjusts to any height of slope within its range. As it is not texture-based, it will not stretch to cover extremely high slopes... but it does have a fairly adequate height range of approx. 32 meters.

    The **Ocean Spillway** is a variation of the standard Spillway that can be used to run your channels into game water oceans or rivers. It is only 2 tiles long and plops just like the CSK Ocean Lock lot.

    The **Garden Waterfall** is a unique variation designed to add a bit of eye-catching class to your cities. It has a particularly stunning effect when used where your canals descend into recreational & even commercial areas. Accordingly, it has an increased park & landmark effect equivalent to that of a large park & plaza. It is also night-lighted so your Sims can continue to enjoy it after the sun sets.

    Unless your barge captains are adrenalin junkies, we would have to classify these waterfalls as non-navigatable. The spillway falls have warning signs and safety chains to stop channel traffic... and the garden falls could easily be classified as a Class 5 Whitewater adventure.

    All 3 lots include a custom waterfall sound effect. They will appear in the Water Transportation Menu along with the other CSK lots. They also have plopping instructions included in the menu descriptions
