  summary: MTP LTUSA Cross Roads
  description: |-
    **LOG TOWN USA**... is a new series for the **MTP** that allows you to sandbox a rustic, remote village without the concern of providing jobs, road access, fire & police or schools & hospitals. Just like modeling the scenery on a model railroad layout, Log Town allows you to focus on the visual... and not worry about the functional. Ideal for sandboxers and CJers.... or anyone who just wants to add a little life to any remote and undeveloped area of your cities.

    All Log Town lots require power and water... but nothing else. They were designed for use with the non-functional PEG Logging Roads but can be used with any custom set of roads or trails... or even the game default functional roads. All of the lots are nite-lited, feature custom 4-combo rotating query sounds, custom background sound effects... and custom queries that simulate functional lots.

    Our first set of lots is the **Cross Roads** collection... a set of 4 corner lots that can be used to create the center of your village... or just plopped anywhere you want to add a bit of older, rustic ambiance. There are 5 lots in this package... which include the following:

    **1\. Logging Road - Cross Roads section**. Adds a new Logging Road section to your menu that is more suited for use with the Log Town lots. Similar to the 4-way section, but with the grass edges removed.

    **2\. Corner General Store**. A classic structure that provides everything from groceries (ie beer) to hardware... to local loggers, miners or residents.

    **3\. The Fuel Depot**. Similar to a gas station. It could be owned and operated by the local logging company to refuel its vehicles... but could also sell retail to local residents and tourists that wander by.

    **4\. The Corner Diner**. Standard greasy spoon... open from breakfast through dinner... and offering everything from the standard truck-stop slop to the latest road kill.

    **5\. The Village Center**. An old-school strip-mall consisting of a barber shop, Dandy's Drugs, the No-tell Hotel and Grady's Tavern. Pretty much the Happenin' Hot Spot for this little berg.

    The **Cross Roads** lots each cost ยง50 to plop... but nothing to maintain. They are located in the Misc Transportation Menu just above the Logging Roads.

    *\* The Log Town series is a more viable and flexible alternative to the classic logger's camp. It represents a more realistic approach to modern logging and mining operations where companies rely more on contract labor and independent commercial ventures would naturally spring up to service the needs of those employed in the area. By not being specific to any one industry or purpose, they can be used in your cities in any fashion that you choose. Standard RCI Ploppable and Growable versions will be released separately.*

    \*\* This lot requires the following dependencies:
