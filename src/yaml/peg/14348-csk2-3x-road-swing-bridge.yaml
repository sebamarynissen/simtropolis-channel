  summary: CSK2 3x Road Swing Bridge
  description: |-
    A common sight among many waterways is the classic Swing Bridge. These are a popular choice for fairly short spans because they are quite easy & cheap to build... and relatively affordable to maintain. In contrast to Lift Bridges, a Swing Bridge simply rotates on a center piling in order to allow river/canal traffic to pass on either side.

    This Swing Bridge is designed for canals that are 3 tiles wide. The lot is also 3 tiles wide, to accommodate the bridge when opened. All other aspects of the bridge are similar to the CSK2 Lift Bridges.

    This bridge is not a static prop. You could say, its a real "Swinger". No, its not into wife swapping and it doesn't play Glenn Miller music. It also doesn't yodel like Tarzan... although I was sorely tempted to make that the custom query sound effect. But it does swing open and closed many times through out the day. When the bridge closes, the safety gates 'swing' up. And when it opens... , the gates 'swing' down.

    This lot plops as part of your channel/canal system. It is fully traffic enabled for all road traffic (peds, cars, buses, trucks, snowmobiles, etc...) & you can see the traffic cross when the bridge is closed. When the bridge is open, traffic will continue to cross however it's not visible and just disappears as it crosses. This was done because the bridge stays open for 2 hours (game time) so that the player can actually see it open... and that's a long time to stop up traffic and would otherwise impact the game.

    These lots have no YIMBY/NIMBY effect, They are cheap to plop and cheap to maintain.

    **\*\* These lots have no external dependencies although installation of the** **[PEG CSK - Channel Stream Kit](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/13461-peg-csk-channel-stream-kit/)** **is recommended.**
