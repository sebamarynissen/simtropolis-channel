  summary: CSK Barges Prop Pack
  description: |-
    This is a prop pack designed for use with the PEG Channel Stream Kit. It contains a collection of small barges that will be used on a variety of CSK lots. As such, this collection will be listed as a Dependency for most CSK add-on packs.... and possibly some CDK lots as well.

    Each of the barges is unique is some fashion... hauling different cargos such as 55 gal. drums and crates, bagged items such as grain, and bulk cargos such as coal, ore and even trash. There are also water taxis and a tour barge as well as several empty barges.

    The barges are included in several new prop families so that they can be made to appear randomly on certain CSK lots... and at different times. This should add a little life and variety to the otherwise static channels.

    The props may also be used by other developers in their creations. The details and specifics are documented in the Developer Notes section of the Readme file.
