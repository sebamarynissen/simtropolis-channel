  summary: Snow Mod Deflowrer Patch
  description: |-
    Please Note: This is another Snow Mod related upload.   
      
    Also Note: This mod can be used with any Snow Mod as it does not affect any snow textures.

    For use with the **[PEG Snow Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22925-peg-snow-mod-2/)**, this patch file allows you to de-flower your cities. The patch file simply removes certain flora props that normally wouldn't appear in a snow covered scene. Don't worry... your lots and cities are not affected in any way. The props are still there. They just won't show... in the snow.

    Specifically, this patch hides all flower props that just look out of place in the snow.  It also conceals several of the smaller bush/brush props that would be covered up by the snow. All palm trees are replaced with pine trees... and the scrub brush that appears at higher elevations when you plant God Mode trees is also hidden.

    Just like the Snow Mod, when you are ready for springtime once again, just remove the mod and everything in the game returns to normal. By default, this mod is installed to the same folder as the Snow Mod, so simply moving that one folder out of your Plugins will uninstall all related Snow mods.

    **\*\* This mod has no dependencies and is designed for use with the [PEG Snow Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22925-peg-snow-mod-2/).**

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
