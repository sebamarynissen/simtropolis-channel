  summary: MTP Mayor Mode Forest Scenes
  description: |-
    This  PEG MTP Series  **Mayor Mod** adds 7 new Forest Scenes to your Mayor Menu. All scenes are click-cyclable from a single Mayor Menu icon.

    Included in this collection:

    \-  A single Picnic Table.

    \- A complete Picnic Area.

    \- A small Shack or Storage Shed.

    \- A Fire Watrch Tower.

    \- An old Donkey Engine.

    \- Everyone's favorite... The Moonshine Still.

    \- And everyone's other favorite... Skinny Dippers in Hot Spring sauce.

    *\* Donkey engines were small steam engines... named after the donkeys they replaced.  They were commonly used in old logging and mine operatrions, primarily as power winches to move heavy objects such as logs and equiptment. Normally, they were mounted on large, wooden skids that allowed them to be easily moved around by horses, other donkey engines.. or even by themselves.  Most were abandoned when the operations closed down and many can still be found out in the woods in various stages of decay.*

    *\* The Fire Watch Tower has an underground foundation that allows it to plop well on most sloped terrain.    The foundation will "dig in" and blend realistically on most slopes or uneven terrain.*

    *\* The Moonshine Still has its own terrain on part of the scene... and like most of these scenes, should not be plopped on steep slopes. And yes... that is me diligently standing guard over the operation.*

    Although there are 5 different sizes/styles of tree... you will find only one icon in your Mayor Menu.  After clicking on the icon and plopping the tree, additional clicks on the plopped tree will cycle through the other available trees. It may require  a few extra clicks to get the exact tree that you want,  but this menu cycling method should keep your Mayor Menu from getting overly cluttered.   
      
    **PLEASE NOTE:**   
      
    If the larger scenes will not fit in the area you are trying to plop them, you will not be able to click-cycle to them. In this instance, you can only cycle through the smaller scenes that fit in that location.   
      
    The cycling effect is not repetitive. Once you have cycled to the last item, additional clicks will have no effect.
