  summary: RTK3 REC AddOn1
  description: |-
    \* This add-on pack includes updated versions of lots in the original Add-On 1 & Add-On 2 packs.

    Here is a collection of new lots for your RTK3 REC style collection. The END sections are the most functional in this add-on. They will allow you to add curved, finished looking ends to your Plaza-style sea walls. Because of the nature of the offset-rendering method used to create this style, separate Left & Right End sections/lots are required.

    If you've ever been asked to take a long walk off a short pier... now you can do it. Included in this pack, is a short walking pier as well as a separate stairway lot that can be used for visual variety as well as access between tiered levels. The fixed height of the stairs will require leveling the terrain to a matching height for proper appearance. This is more of an "advanced" section for those who are comfortable with altering their terrain.
