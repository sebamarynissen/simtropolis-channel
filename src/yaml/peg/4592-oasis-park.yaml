  summary: Oasis Park
  description: |-
    The Oasis Park has returned with a few graphic upgrades. Two new BAT models have been added to give the oasis an improved 3D appearance and an upgraded surrounding wall. Other than being transit enabled for pedestrians, this park is identical to a large park in all aspects. It has lots of palms and other foliage and could be used as either an Oasis or Jungle themed park. A little break from the traditional for your Sims!
