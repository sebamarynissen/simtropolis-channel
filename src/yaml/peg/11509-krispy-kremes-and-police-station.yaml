  summary: Krispy Kremes and Police Station
  description: |-
    How often have we heard someone ask, "Where's a cop when you really need one?  Now we know...

    In communities where there is a Krispy Kremes, there just doesn't seem to be a need for a dedicated police station. Why not just move headquarters into the local doughnut shop and save everyone a lot of time and expense.

    And that's what we've done. Call it a progressive experiment in social practicality if you prefer, but we've moved the cops to where they'd rather be... closer to the action both on the streets and in the fryer.

    This package contains two versions of the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts store:

    1\. Police Station - Functions as a police station with properties identical to those of the small police precinct.

    2\. A ploppable commercial landmark with 32 jobs. Because of it's instinctive attractive to law enforcement officials, this version also provides heightened police protection to the surrounding area. (similar to a Police Kiosk)

    \* An 'as of yet' unproven growable version is included as well. There have been no reported sightings of it in any test cities which may be be due to its size, unfulfilled requirements... or it just plain doesn't work. It its there is anyone wishes to play with it. If it is sighted in your city, we'd appreciate a report about it.

    \*\* Versions are contained in separate files so any one can be removed after installation if not wanted.

    **\*\*\* Requires installation of the [PEG Cop Car Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11186-peg-cop-car-mod/)**
