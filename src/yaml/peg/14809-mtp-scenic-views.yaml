    "Down in the valley... the valley so low.   Hang your head over.... Let your lunch go!!"

    By request... we have added 4 new MTP style lots to add along your remote roadways or incorporate into your Mountain Trail system. These scenic look-outs will add an extra realistic feel to your blossoming mountainous and rural regions. No detail has been "overlooked" \[drum hit\]... including the prerequisite stone mounted plaque (recycled ranger station sign) that always recounts that here, on this spot, at some time, long ago, someone, did something note worthy. Thus, the plaque!

    The lots are designed to be plopped along the top of moderately steep cliffs. The viewing decks will extend over the edge  and their foundations/supports will blend in with the face of the cliff. There are 4 lots in total; 2 for use with the PEG Mountain Trails and 2 for general use along any roadways. Additionally, there are 2 different styles of viewing decks; a standard straight deck and an "L" shaped deck for use on corners. The straight decks are part of a random prop family that includes 5 different styles of  foundations/supports.

    Most of the lots provide some sort of rest-stop/picnic facilities. The straight roadside lot features an asphalt parking area that is transit enabled for a seamless connection to any adjacent roadway. All of the lots are very similar to a normal Mountain Trail lot with mild park & landmark properties and very little monthly maintenance costs. Lot sizes range from 1x1 to 2x2.

    \* The 2 different types of lots, Roadside & Mountain Trail, are contained in separate files so can easily remove either one if you choose not to use it. The Mountain Trail lots will appear in the Parks Menu, along with the other Mountain Trail lots. The roadside lots will appear in the Misc. Transportation Menu below the MTP Parking Lot lots..
