  summary: PIER SET Volume One
  description: |-
    Back by popular demand and fully upgraded, the old CDK modular Pier Pack has returned as the new **PEG Pier Set**. These lots are pure eye-candy, Boys & Girls. Their job and sole purpose of being is to sit there and do nothing but just look cool !!

    For those who are not familiar with the old pier pack, the PierSet is a collection of modular pier sections that the player can mix & match to create his/her own piers... of any shape & any size. You can create long, straight piers... or even short ones for that long walk everyone keeps suggesting you take. Or create complex pier systems of any length or shape. You can also use them to create pedestrian bridges (non transit functional) across rivers or bays... and to connect islands. The lots conduct power, of course, so they make a great alternative to stringing unsightly high tension lines.

    Updates in this new set include a remodeled 2-piece pier base that is tapered to reduce that 'solid wall' look, which is necessary to work around the game's limitations regarding water lots. The single new base foundation replaces separate  custom models for each lot... thus reducing the overall file size and resource usage in the game.

    Also new for the Piers is the **Boat Pass** section which, used in pairs, creates a passage that your water automata can pass under. Used liberally, it also gives your piers a more open look and breaks up that solid wall effect.

    Each pier section is affordably priced and only $1 to maintain.... making large pier systems affordable even on a non-money-cheat budget. Each pier section also has a very slight YIMBY park/plaza effect which, collectively will improve desirability in the area without blowing out any caps.

    There are 7 basic lots in the PerSet Volume 1, which are:

    -   **1x Straight Pier Section** - Standard straight section of pier with a solid base.  
         
    -   **1x2 Boat Pass Section** - Actually a 1x1 lot, the BoatPass section has an offset bridge section that extends to cover the adjacent tile. Used in pairs, they create an open passage that the game's water automata can pass under.  
         
    -   **1x Corner, Tee,  4-way & End Sections** - Standard modular pier sections with solid bases that can be connected together to form piers of almost any size & shape.  
         
    -   **1x2 Pier Head** - A CDK style lot with properties similar to a small plaza. Use this lot to connect your piers to shore. Similar to the CDK Pier Head lot, but higher to match the height of the PierSet piers. Can be used by itself or with any other CDK style of lots.
