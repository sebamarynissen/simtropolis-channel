  summary: MTP No Roadway Junk MOD
  description: |-
    Designed for use with the MTP, rural themed or industrial cities, this mod removes all the "roadway junk" from streets, roads, on-way roads and avenues. This "junk" includes mailboxes, benches, trees, flower planters... and most of the other small props that line the sidewalks in the city.

    Most of these little props look great in a large urban city or even in "the burbs"...  but they look out of place in a rural, mountainous, or industrial city. The mod was originally designed to compliment the mods that removed sidewalks for the MTP... but it can be useful anywhere you don't want those big city props cluttering up your sidewalks.

    The mod removes all sidewalk props, except for people props and the fire hydrants,  which are appropriate for all types of cities. Also, all street lights have been replaced with the more rural/industrial looking wooden pole street lights. For the avenues, all the center barriers & foliage have been removed. This provides a more realistic look for rural themed cities.

    The mod is broken down into 4 separate files; one each for streets, roads, one-way roads and avenues. After installation, you can easily remove any of the files you do not wish to use. For example, if you like the way the mod works for your streets and roads, but prefer to keep your avenues the way they are, just remove the files for the avenues.

    Collectively, these mods remove a substantial number of props from your city. Depending on the power of your computer system, the size of the city and the detail level selected, you may experience a notable performance increase.

    IMPORTANT:  Because the mod changes props on the network tiles, you will not notice any changes on existing roadways until you re-plop them. Fortunately, re-plopping just a single roadway tile will often update a very large area... so you do not have to re-plop all your roadways. Also, the roadways will update automatically any time there is growth or a change in a nearby zoned tile.
