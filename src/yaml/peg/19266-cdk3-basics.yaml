  summary: 6 basic lots that can be used to form a developed industrial look along your coastlines.
  description: |-
    Time to get back to **The Basics**. This is a collection of 6, basic CDK3 lots that are quite similar to the standard CDK\-IND lots. Included are an Inner Corner & Outer Corner lot, a 1x wide and a 3x wide Dock lot, a Ramp lot and a Steps lot.

    Like the original CDK\-IND lots, you can use these lots to form a developed industrial look along your coastlines. You can use these to replace your existing CDK\-IND lots, or keep both styles installed and mix them up. These new lots do not replace the older style and will appear separately in your Water Transportation Menu.

    All of these lots are 3 tiles deep, in contrast to the 2 tile deep CDK\-IND lots. This extra depth includes a dirt service road that runs behind all lots and helps tie them together visually. The 3x wide Dock Lot provides jobs and is transit enabled for a street connection. The Inner Corner lot also is transit enabled for street connections but does not have jobs... so providing road access is optional.

    Although designed for use along a coastline and partially plopped in the water, these lots can also be used on dry land and look pretty darn good  when placed next to railroad lines.

    *These lots require the **PEG\-CDK3 Resource Pack 1** and the **PEG\-CDK3 Vehicles Pack 1** dependency files.*
