  summary: CDK-OWW Commercial Style
  description: |-
    Pegasus Productions is pleased to release an all-new CDK style that will bring the romance and history of the sea to your cities. Somewhere between the sun bleached planks and the creosote covered pilings, you can almost hear the creaking of the beams as the **Old Wooden Waterfront** stands as a monument to man's never-ending quest to tame the world's oceans.

    Our initial release is a purely commercial venture with 8 new seawall-plaza lots designed to promote commercial development along your shorelines. The rustic, nautical theme is a proven winner in attracting large crowds to shopping and tourist attractions... and you can now put that to work in your cities. Whether they are freely mixed in with other CDK styles or used exclusively on their own, these seaside plazas will really boost your commercial development.

    With the exception of the seaside Parking Lot Plaza, which also  functions like a parking garage and promotes the use of mass transit in residential areas, these lots are all small, medium or large plazas and priced accordingly. They have the same properties and costs as their default game counterparts. All are transit enabled for pedestrians with the Parking Lot being enabled for auto traffic as well and requiring road access.

    As with all new CDK\-OWW styled lots, you will have the option to 'fine tune' their appearance by installing one of several STYLE files that alter the front facade of the seawalls globally throughout the game. These STYLE files are included with the **PEG CDK\-OWW Development Kit Volume 1** and several new styles are under development that can be 'plugged-in' at any time.

    This install contains the following lots:

    1\. 1x2 Seaside Plaza (small plaza)  
    2\. 1x2 Seaside Plaza w/ access ramp (small plaza)  
    3\. 1x2 Seaside Plaza w/ fountain (small plaza)  
    4\. 1x2 Seaside Parking Lot (small plaza & reduced 1/2 capacity parking structure)  
    5\. 3x2 Seaside Fountain Plaza (large plaza)  
    6\. 1x2 Public Pier (medium plaza) \* Extends 4 tiles into the water.  
    7\. 2x2 Inner Corner Plaza (medium plaza)  
    8\. 2x2 Outer Corner Plaza (medium plaza)

    **\*\***These lots require the installation of the **PEG CDK\-OWW Development Kit Volume 1**

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
