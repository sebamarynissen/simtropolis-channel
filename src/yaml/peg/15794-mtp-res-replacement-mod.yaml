# Something's wrong with the R$ part of this mod. The lots don't reference the 
# proper buildings apparently.

#   summary: MTP RES Replacement Mod
#   description: |-
#     This is the first complete or "Mondo" Mod for the **MTP** that completely replaces the game's default Residential Lots with Mountainous/Rural versions designed for the MTP Theme. **Every** game-default Residential lot has been modified or replaced with MTP styled lots and buildings. Similar to a new tile set, this mod goes beyond by actually changing the appearance of the lots as well and giving your game a completely different look.

#     Like SimMars, the **MTP** is a full, new **Theme** for your game. And with the new Start-Up Manager, playing multiple themes is no longer a nasty chore of having to manually rename and remove files & folders. That means you can easily switch between your normal cities and regions and any new Theme, like the MTP.

#     The MTP is being released in bits & pieces as they become available. This will allow you to easily choose which components to install or not. You also will not have to wait until the entire theme is complete in order to enjoy it. In its entirety, the MTP Theme will completely change the appearance of your game as well as how you play it.

#     To conserve game resources, game-default props and buildings have been re-used wherever possible, Still, scores of new props & textures and no less than 20 new, custom residential buildings have been included in this mod. In total, the mod includes **over 330 new residential lots** that replace the game-default lots.
