  summary: Caisson Style Lighthouse
  description: |-
    Our second offering in the Lighthouse series features a replica of the Hooper Island Lighthouse which is still in operation in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. A classic caisson style lighthouse, the Hooper Bay Light was first lit in 1902.

    The caisson is sunk 13.5 feet into the muddy bottom of the Bay. The light stands 63 feet above the water. The inside of the metal tower is lined with white-glazed brick and there are 4 living levels, plus the watch room and lantern levels. This light was automated in 1961 and the keepers removed.  In 1976 the 4th order Fresnel lens was stolen and the Coast Guard replaced it with a solar optic.

    This version of the Lighthouse functions like the game's default lighthouse in all regards, including plop & maintenance costs. It is a Reward, but it is not conditional. You do not need  to have a seaport for it to become available. This will allow you to also use it in non-industrial cities where a seaport would be useless.

    Like the previous Lighthouse Island version, this lighthouse also does not replace the game's default lighthouse. The primary reason for this is that the default lighthouse is land-based... and this version obviously is not. A forced replacement could cause issues when upgrading. With separate versions, you can continue to enjoy the default lighthouse or any replacement for it you have installed... or reclaim the land it occupies and replace it with this water-based version at your leisure.
