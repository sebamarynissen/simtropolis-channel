  summary: Trail Parks III
  description: |-
    The PEG Trail Parks have returned with a whole new visual makeover. This initial release introduces the new version of the basic Trail Parks... designed to blend seamlessly with the the [PEG Random Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4526-peg-random-woods-v206/) & the [PEG Stream Kit II](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11083-peg-stream-kit-ii-v205/).

    These new parks feature BAT modeled pathways that replace the old textured paths. This means that the paths now show while you are plopping the lots. This makes them much easier to use.

    These Trail Parks also feature two new trail lots that will allow you to run your trails anywhere. The new EL Transit lot will allow you to extend the trails under elevated rail & highways. The new Pedestrian Tunnel allows you to visually run your trails under any road or rail... or even under entire buildings or blocks.

    **All Pegasus files are now legacy content and are no longer officially supported - however support from the wider community can be requested [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/)**.
