  summary: Non-functional version of `pkg=peg:cdk3-sp-container-seaport`.
  description: |-
    The CDK3\-SP Container Dock is similar to the Container Seaport in appearance. But it is not a functional seaport. Its designed purpose is to visually extend your container processing operations in and around your seaport complex.

    Slightly smaller at only 9 tiles wide, the cental rail connection has been replaced with a single, centered street entrance. The number of cranes have been reduced from three to two so the lot can be easily discerned from a functional seaport. As multiple instances of this lot are likely to be used, the lot uses more random truck, rail car and container props to add more visual variety.

    The lot is technically a ploppable IND-D lot with jobs, costs and properties similar to the CDK3 Vandy Trucking lot. Because of the jobs, the lot requires road access.

    Transit Enabled Driveway  
    The lot's driveway is transit enabled as a street to avoid forcing an intersection. The transit enabling is visual only... to allow a visual connection to the adjacent road.  The lot will not allow pedestrian or vehicle traffic to pass through it.  
      
    Transit Enabled Rail  
    The rail running through the lot is fully transit enabled to allow both passenger and freight rail to pass through the lot. This is an optional feature to give the player greater flexibility in using the lot. However, the lot itself does not require functional rail in any way and in most applications, the functional aspect of the rail can simply be ignored.  
      
    Lot Spacing  
    These lots can not be plopped adjacent to each other. The ships are slightly longer than the lot and would "smush" together.  The CDK3\-SP 1x Lots are ideal for adding the required spacing between any of the lots that have ships.
