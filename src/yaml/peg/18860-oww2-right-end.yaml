  summary: This dedicated right-side lot neatly ends both the OWW2 and Marina sections
  description: |-
    "Second verse... same as the first...". This lot is a dedicated Right-side End section for both the OWW2 and CDKM Marina. It visually closes off the seawall/boardwalk and rear parking area.   Its nearly identical to the Left-End lot but with a slightly different boardwalk. All properties are similar to the OWW2 1x Plaza lot.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading **The Official CDK Tutorial.**

       
    **\*\* This lot requires the following dependencies**

     PEG\-CDKM Marina  
     PEG\-OWW2 Resource Pack 1
