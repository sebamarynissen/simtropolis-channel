  summary: Charas BT Records
  description: |-
    The Recording Industry hits town in a big way as industry icon ***B&T Records*** decides to move their corporate headquarters to your city. B&T Records may have started as a backwater recording studio but it quickly skyrocketed to the top by signing only the best such as international recording artist and the Goddess of Country, **Chara**... who is also the company's CEO.

    B&T understands the space constraints in your city so they have designed an innovative building that will maximize the wasted space under any urban freeway. The structure will be built under the freeway as well as around it... and it will even build over it with 2 connecting skywalks.

    This building is big-bucks COM  providing up to 3,500 jobs. You're gonna need that freeway and plenty of access via adjacent off-ramps. You might also want to consider placing various types of mass transit stations in the area as well.

    This lot has no dependencies. It utilizes a custom BAT modeled base as well as 7 other custom BAT models designed exclusively for this lot. It features a semi-symmetrical design in that there is no definitive "front-side" to the lot... which allows you greater flexibility in how you plop it.  The helicopter is functional, generally taking off and landing when ever the city is loaded.

    ***B&T Records... Proving that there is always a place where dreams can come true.***
