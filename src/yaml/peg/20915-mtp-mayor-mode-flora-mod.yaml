  summary: MTP Mayor Mode Flora Mod
  description: |-
    This  PEG MTP Series  Mayor Mod adds some extra smaller forest plants that you can plop around your forest. Like the other MTP Mayor Mods, this mod also uses the single menu icon click-cycle method to conserve menu space.  
      
    **PLEASE NOTE:**   
      
    If the larger plants will not fit in the area you are trying to plop them, you will not be able to click-cycle to them. In this instance, you can only cycle through the smaller plants that fit in that location.   
      
    The cycling effect is not repetitive. Once you have cycled to the last item, additional clicks will have no effect.
