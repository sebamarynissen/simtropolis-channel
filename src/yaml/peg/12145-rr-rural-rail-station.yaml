  summary: RR Rural Rail Station
  description: |-
    By request, the PEG Rural Rail Station is a basic passenger railroad station in an older, rural wrapper. It has the same  properties as the game's default passenger station.

    Other than visually, the primary difference with the Rural Rail Station is that it is smaller at only 2x2 tiles in size. The Taxi Maker occupant group has also been removed to prevent the station from spawning and endless line of taxi cabs. Generally, taxi service in rear-world rural areas is either non-existent or a quaint novelty.
