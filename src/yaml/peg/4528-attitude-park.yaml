  summary: Attitude Park
  description: |-
    For Sims with a "Tude!!!" The City Council was hesitant at first, but the Mayor knew what he/she was doing. "Give the People what they want"... and this expressive statue was exactly that. The Sims love this statue because its exactly how they feel. Whether it stems from political misgivings, social concerns, or the jerk that cut them off in traffic... this statue says it all. Your Sims just feel better driving past it or standing before it and venting their rage. It is, after all, all about "attitude!!"

    These lots, offered in both a park and plaza style, are a true blend of large park & large plaza with all the benefits associated with both. Pricing and maintenance are the same as a large plaza.
