  summary: CSK2 Fountains
  description: |-
    This add-on includes 2 differently styled water fountains you can use in your CSK2 channels & canals.  They are simple 1x1 water tiles with a variety of game default fountain effects combined into a scenic and mesmerizing fountain display.

    Both are night lighted for even greater visual appeal after the sun sets. And both use the PEG modified 24/7 fountain effects (included) so the fountains will not shut down at sunset.

    The fountains can be used singularly or combined together to form even more dazzling water displays. Both fountains have mild park/landmark properties equivalent to about half of the values of a small plaza.
