  summary: CSK2 "What's Up, Dock?"
  description: |-
    So... What's Up, Dock?  Our next installment for the CSK2 is appropriately misnamed as its loaded with nothing but industrial docks for your channel and canal systems. Nothing says **"Industrial Grunge"** better than murky water lapping up against creosote pilings with the occasional 3-eyed fish floating on the surface.

    This collection of 6 new lots for the CSK2 will allow you to build an active waterfront in and around your industrial areas.  These docks are loaded for bear with ever-changing barge traffic, shuffling dock cargo and plenty of hourly workers trying to look busy until their next coffee break.

    The 6 lots included are:

    -   3 different styles of 1x1 Docks you can use to create variety along your riverfronts.
    -   A 3x1 row of Extended Docks to quickly cover long stretches of waterfront.
    -   An Inner & an Outer Corner Dock so you can build continuous docks of any shape or size.  
         

    All dock lots have no positive or negative effects on the surrounding area.  They are YIMBY/NIMBY non-gratis. They do produce a very small amount of water pollution but nothing collectively noticeable. Each lot costs 1 buck to maintain and they are all very reasonably priced to plop. They will appear in your Water Transportation Menu below the other CSK2 lots.
