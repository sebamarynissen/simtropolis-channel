  summary: Snow Mod MTP Patch
  description: |-
    For use with the **PEG Snow Mod**, this patch replaces all of the lot base and overlay textures used by the MTP with Snow Mod compliant textures. It also updates many of the custom textures used on PEG lots released prior to the MTP.

    Even if you do not use the MTP or any of the MTP lots, keep in mind that other custom lots have used the textures introduced with the MTP and other PEG Productions lots. If you are using the Snow Mod, it just might be prudent to have the patch installed... just in case.

    Just like the Snow Mod, when you are ready for springtime once again, just remove the mod and everything in the game returns to normal. By default, this mod is installed to the same folder as the Snow Mod, so simply moving that one folder out of your Plugins will uninstall all related Snow mods.

    **\*\* This mod has no dependencies and is designed for use**  **PEG Snow Mod.**
