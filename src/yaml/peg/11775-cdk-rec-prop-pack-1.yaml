  summary: CDK-REC Prop Pack 1
  description: |-
    This is the first volume of props designed for exclusive use with the PEG\-CDK REC style lots. Intended primarily for use as a dependency file, the props it contains can also be used by lot developers. Used in conjunction with the PEG\-CDK REC Seawall Kit, developers can now create their own CDK REC styled lots.

    These props are all "**offset-rendered**". This means that they can visually extend beyond the edges of the lot for placement out over the water. The props included in this volume are:

    **\* Trawlers**

    \- Two variations of the classic commercial fishing boat... generic enough for use as any type of small work or fishing industry boat.

    **\* Commercial Pier**

    \- A short but rugged wooden pier suitable for a variety of commercial, industrial & recreational purposes.

    **\* Water Taxi**

    \- Built from a mesh of the famous African Queen and now used as a novel water taxi that is popular with tourists & locals alike, this boat has been featured in several water lots.

    **\* Freight Shuttle**

    \- A variation of the Water Taxi,  small boats such as this are commonplace around harbors and waterfronts as they ferry freight, supplies and passengers around the port and out to anchored ships.

    **\* Fish Stand**

    \- A modelrama of an active fresh fish stand... a fairly common sight in one form or another around an active fishing industry.

    **\* Peeps**

    \- A group of 3 people that can be placed out on a dock, pier or seawall. The game's props, including the animated people props, can not be extended beyond the lots borders. This prop allows you to put a little life out over the water.  

    Lot developers may use the props contained in this product to enhance the development of their own lots by referencing this material as a "Dependency" only. The contents of this product file may not be altered, removed or copied into any other file. This file may not be redistributed or included with any other lots or material.
