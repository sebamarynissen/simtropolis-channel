    **PEG MTP Mountain Trails
    By Pegasus**

    As part of the MTP upgrade, the classic Pine Trails have been modified to be "tree-type indifferent". In other words, you can now use them with any trees types you choose. Based upon requests on the support site, the pine tree props have been removed and these new Mountain Trails are now more flexible than ever.

    Other modifications include the use of the new blended MTP forest floor texturing along with a new & more subtle 'dirtier' dirt path. These are the same textures used in other MTP lots so they will all blend together quite well. Also, there has been an overall reduction in YIMBY effects  to avoid blowing over caps... and the plop prices have been reduced accordingly. All other aspects of the lots remain the same and they still adapt to sloped terrain extremely well..

    This Trail Park pack contains these lots:

    1\. A 1x1 Straight section.  (§10/§1)
    \* The standard straight piece.

    2\. A 3x1 straight section. (§15/§2)
    \* A 3x1 version of the standard straight piece.

    3\. A Corner section. (§20/§1)
    \* A standard 90 degree turn or corner section.

    4.  A Tee section. (§25/§1)
    \* A standard 'Tee' or 3-way intersection.

    5.  A 4-way section. (§30/§1)
    \* A standard 4-way intersection
