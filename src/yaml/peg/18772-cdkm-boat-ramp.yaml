  summary: The formal left-end to the Marina complex. This lot visually doses off the boardwalk and parking area
  description: |-
    No self respecting Marina is complete without a boat ramp. So here ya go. This lot provides everything required for your Sims to launch their small, trailered boats. (ie... a ramp. Beer not included.) It is a 2x3 CS$$ ploppable lot that provides jobs and income from taxes.

    The lot is a CDKM Marina modular lot that aligns with the the boardwalks and parking areas of other CDKM lots. The lot will also be compatible with the new CDK Seaport Village & CDK\-OWW collections.

    The most important function of this lot is to serve as the formal left-end to the Marina complex. The lot visually closes off the boardwalk and parking areas.  
      
    The lot uses timed, shuffling props to simulate boat launching activity. During the day, various trailered boats and cars will appear and disappear on & around the ramp.

    For help creating the perfect terrain for CDK lots, we strongly recommend reading **The Official CDK Tutorial.**
