  summary: Screw Pile Lighthouses
  description: |-
    Our third offering in the Lighthouse series features one of the most famous and recognizable lighthouses in the Chesapeake Bay. The **Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse** was first lit in 1875 and is still in operation today.

    The hexagonal cottage style lighthouse sits atop seven 10-inch diameter wrought-iron screw piles that are screwed 11 feet, 6 inches into the bottom of the bay. The screw pile foundation is very sturdy but has been damaged in the past by ice floes. In 1886-87, 1600 cubic yards of loose rock, called "riprap" were poured around the piles for extra protection.

    This package contains 3 versions of the lighthouse:

    **Version 1:**  
    This version of the Lighthouse functions like the game's default lighthouse in all regards, including plop & maintenance costs. It is a Reward, but it is not conditional. You do not need  to have a seaport for it to become available. This will allow you to also use it in non-industrial cities where a seaport would be useless.

    Like the previous Lighthouse Island version, this lighthouse also does not replace the game's default lighthouse. The primary reason for this is that the default lighthouse is land-based... and this version obviously is not. A forced replacement could cause issues when upgrading. With separate versions, you can continue to enjoy the default lighthouse or any replacement for it you have installed... or reclaim the land it occupies and replace it with this water-based version at your leisure.

    **Version 2:**  
    Several older screw pile styled lighthouses were rescued when they were decommissioned and have been moved onshore where they now serve as museums and tourist attractions. The Drum Point Lighthouse, which is very similar in appearance to the Thomas Point Light, is one of the most famous of these Lights that have found a new home and purpose ashore.

    In recognition of this effort to preserve our nautical tradition and heritage, this package contains a second version of this lighthouse that is a functioning museum and can be plopped on shore. It is a separate file that can easily be uninstalled if not needed. The land-based lighthouse/museum has the same properties and pricing of the game's default museum.

    **Version 3:**  
    This package also contains a 3rd version of the lighthouse for the CDK. Like the museum version, the CDK version is also a  retired lighthouse, preserved and relocated to serve as a tourist attraction for your Seaport Village or anywhere along your coast. This version has most of the properties and benefits of the Tourist Trap reward.

    **\*\*Versions 1 & 2 have No External Dependencies.  
    The CDK version requires that the CDK\-OWW be installed.**
