    **NO MORE BROWN BOXES !!**
    By Pegasus

    This is a quick & dirty little mod that replaces those big ugly brown packages... with little ugly multi-colored "smudges". The advantage here is that Multi-Color Smudge is quite small... and does not cover the entire lot.

    The disadvantage to the default ugly brown packages, besides being brown... and ugly... is that it covers up the entire friggin' lot. This prevents you from being able to see which item on the lot is causing the problem... and often from even being able to see which lot has the issue.

    Technically, this mod simply overrides those brown package models (there are of 5 in total, all different sizes) and forces the game to display the default multi-color smudge it normally displays when it can't find a model's graphic files. The mod is a minimal 36k in size so there is almost no game resource usage. And although the Multi-Color Smudges are small, they are still quite easy to see... which makes spotting a problem almost as easy as noticing a big, honking, brown ugly box in the middle of downtown.
