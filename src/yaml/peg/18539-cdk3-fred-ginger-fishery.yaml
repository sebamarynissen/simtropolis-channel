  summary: This fishery lot provides IR jobs and lots of fresh fish for your sims to eat.
  description: |-
    As vast as the oceans are, they still do not contain enough fish to sustain man's ever-expanding appetite. Commercial fish farms are the planet's best hope to feed its citizens while preventing the natural fish supply from being depleted. The age old profession of fisherman is being replaced by the equally as old profession of farmer.

    Although commonly referred to as "fish farms, they are technically fish ranches. Like cattle or sheep, fish are bred in captivity and harvested for food. And being grown in a controlled environment, they have no natural predators and are protected from diseases and pollutants that could reduce their numbers.

    The costs of maintaining the fish and farms is more than offset by the reduced cost of harvesting. No expensive fishing fleets to purchase and maintain. No excessive use of petrol fuels consumed while trolling the oceans in search of fish. No risk of losing boats and crews to storms and other nautical dangers. Plus... no freakin' Greenpeace rubber boats to "accidentally" run over.

    This lot is s standard CDK3 lot that is 4x6 tiles in size. The lot must be plopped out over the water... with either 2 or 3 rows of tiles on dry land. It provides Industrial Resource (farming) jobs in areas where that normally would not be possible. The lot is located in the Water Transportation menu along with the other CDK3 lots. The single lot file contains all required custom material so the lot can be used without installing the CDK3.

    **This lot has no dependencies.**
