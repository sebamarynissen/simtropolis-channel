  summary: MTP Mountain Trail Fire Circle
  description: |-
    Kumbaya, My Friends... Kumbaya!!  The translation of this Gullah word was made famous by the popular campfire song, and  means "***come by here***". And that is certainly the message that campgrounds want to get out to campers on the trail.

    No self-respecting campground is with out the classic fire circle/amphitheater where the campers gather at night to hear tales from the rangers of local folklore and the history of the surrounding area. A raging fire, a good show by the rangers and plenty of group sing-along songs before hiking back to the campsite and bedding down for the night.

    The Campfire Circle / Amphitheater lot is designed for use with the [PEG Mountain Trails](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30680-peg-mtp-mountain-trails/) and fits right in with the other campground lots included in the [Mountain Trail Recreation Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/14056-peg-mtp-mountain-trails-rec-pack-1/)**.** It features a dual-model amphitheater prop that is largely empty by day. But when the sun sets, the amphitheater fills up with campers, the fire is lit, and the fire glow sets the mood for the often haunting, but always fun & humorous show put on by the rangers.

    \* The lot also contains a custom audio track. If you listen carefully, you can hear the crickets and occasional owls hooting in the distance.

    Like the other Mountain Trail campground lots, the Fire Circle has minor YIMBY effects... somewhat less than a small park. Its very affordable to maintain and quite cheap to build. "Someone's Plopping, Lord... Kumbaya...".

    **\*\* This lot requires the following dependencies: [PEG MTP Super Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/)**
