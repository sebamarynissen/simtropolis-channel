  summary: CSK2 Varible Width Canals
  description: |-
    This is the inevitable evolution of the **Channel Stream Kit**... a variable width Canal system. You can now mix & match your single tile width CSK Channels with channels & canals you create of any width. Like the CSK lots, the variable width **CSK2** lots are styled to blend with all areas of your city and look great in both industrial and recreational zones.

    These lots are very similar to the **[PEG PPOND KIT](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21661-peg-ppond-kit/)** lots and plop in the same manner. Their pricing and YIMBY effects have been reduced substantially, however they still retain the same slope handling abilities of the Ponds and Streams.

    This is the 'starter pack'. Numerous add-ons are in development to expand the channel-canal system even further and provide a vast collection of waterway lots for your cities.

    There are 7 basic lots in this initial release, which are:

    -   **1x & 3x Straight Channel Banks** - Standard straight channel / canal bank sections.  
         
    -   **1x & 2x2 Water Sections** -  Solid water sections that can be used to make your channels as wide as you want.  
         
    -   **1x Outer Corner** - Used to created smooth, finished corners Very flexible and can be used in a variety of ways to joins various lots together  
         
    -   **1x Inner Corners (Squared & Rounded)** - The standard corner sections in two styles; squared and rounded. Together, they can be used to create some uniquely shaped channels and basins.  
         
    -   **Transition Tee to the 1x CSK Channels** - Similar to the Outer corner... but with corner sections on both sides. Designed specifically to merge the variable width **CSK2** lots with the single-tile width CSK channels.

    **\*\* This Kit has no external dependencies although installation of the** **PEG CSK** **is recommended.**
