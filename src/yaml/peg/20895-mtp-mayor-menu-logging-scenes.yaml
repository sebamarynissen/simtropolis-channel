  summary: MTP Mayor Menu Logging Scenes
  description: |-
    This PEG MTP Series MOD adds 6 new ploppable ***Logging Props & Scenes*** to your Mayor Menu... all accessible from a single, cyclable menu icon. From a single tree stump prop to fully detailed modelramas, these no-cost, ploppable forest accessories can add life and character to your forests. Mix and match and create any size of a logging operation you want.

    The mod is fully self contained. You do not need to install any particular tree mod or style. Nor do any of the scenes contain any tree models so they can be used with any God or Mayor Mode tree mod without having incompatible tree types together.

    Although there are 6 different scenes to choose from...you will find only one icon in your Mayor Menu. After clicking on the icon and plopping the scene, additional clicks on the plopped scene will cycle through the other available scenes. It may require a few extra clicks to get the exact scene that you want, but this menu cycling method should keep your Mayor Menu from getting overly cluttered.  
      
    **PLEASE NOTE:**  
      
    If the larger scenes will not fit in the area you are trying to plop them, you will not be able to click-cycle to them. In this instance, you can only cycle through the smaller scenes that fit in that location. An easy solution to this is to bulldoze the nearby trees, plop the desired scene, then go back with the Mayor Mode menu and replop single trees around the scene.  
      
    The cycling effect is not repetitive. Once you have cycled to the last item, additional clicks will have no effect.

    *\*\* No real trees were harmed in the development or implementation of this mod. All trees depicted in the screen shots were hugged hourly... per their contract. PEG Loggers only remove trees that have died of natural causes or have been mortally injured and are suffering.*

    *In some instances as required, some trees are tagged by the Forestry Service for removal based on certain criteria that includes; Trees that are ugly, mean or stupid, Trees that drop leaves, needles or squirrel poop into the pool of the Director of the Forestry Service, Trees that hug back... and Trees with a demonstrated root fetish for sewer pipes.*
