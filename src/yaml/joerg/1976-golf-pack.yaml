  description: |-
    Dont you want to make a great looking golf course in any shape you want and not have to fiddle with the LE. Well your wish be granted. All the rich sims use this pack of country club lots every day.

    To install simply place in your plugins folder.

    In SC4 the lots are under health becuase the menus are getting full else where and anyway golfing is a very healthy hobby.

    This is version 1.1 now incluseds a driving range and putting surface.

    Enjoy and read the readme.
