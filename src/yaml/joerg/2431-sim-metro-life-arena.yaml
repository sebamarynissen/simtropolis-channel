    The Sim Metro Life arena is the perfect Indoor/Outdoor retractible roof arena for your sims to enjoy sporting events conventions and many other activites.

    I may make an updated version in the near future wiht more details but for now here it is. I hope you enjoy. Also Dialupers beware its over 5 megs.

    Ok now updated with added jobs and stadium effect found in the rewards menu. You cant acctually see the jobs but they shoudl be there.
