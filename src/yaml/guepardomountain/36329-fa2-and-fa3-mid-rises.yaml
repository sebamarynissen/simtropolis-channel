  summary: FA2 and FA3 Mid-rises
  description: |-
    This is a set of four buildings for fractionally angled networks. Included is an FA2 building overhanging a 2x2 lot, an FA3 building overhanging a 3x2 lot, and a mirrored version of each.

    They are inspired by mid-rise New York apartment buildings, but are ploppable, rather than residential, so that they can be placed along FA roads.

    Each building costs $100 to plop, and functions as a landmark.

    No dependencies!
