  summary: Diagonal Mid-Rises
  description: |-
    I made these to fill in some of the spaces in diagonal blocks. They're inspired by apartment buildings in NYC. Included are three models, each with two different color/mirror variations for a total of six lots. They are in the Landmark menu and cost $100 each to plop. No dependencies.
