  summary: NYC T-Shaped Apartments
  description: |-
    This is a pack of eight different buildings. Apartments like these can be found throughout New York City. There are four designs, each with two color/detail variations. Continuing my pattern of naming buildings after fabrics, they are called Dupioni, Mikado, Shantung, and Taffeta.

    These include custom foundations which will appear when the lots grow on sloped terrain.
