  summary: Charmeuse Apartments
  description: |-
    I've been wanting to add more slope-friendly buildings to my cities for a long time. This NYC-inspired apartment building has a custom foundation, and the stairs and ramps will show on mildly sloped terrain. It is a medium density residential lot and only grows on the New York tileset.

    Lot Size: 3x2

    Growth Stage: 6

    Capacity: 255 R$$

    Building Style: New York

    Power Consumed: 4

    Water Consumed: 36
