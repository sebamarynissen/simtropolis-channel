  summary: Suburban Shops - Diagonal and Orthogonal
  description: |-
    Three small businesses situated in a single nondescript building, perfect for the transition between low density residential neighborhoods and denser commercial districts.

    Included is a 2x3 growable orthogonal lot, a 1x1 ploppable diagonal with just the building, and a 1x2 ploppable diagonal with an attached parking lot. The version with the parking lot can only be placed on flat terrain.

    Each has 44 CS$ jobs.

    Dependencies:

    [BSC Texture Pack Cycledogg V01](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack)

    [GM Props Vol 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36517-gm-props-vol-1/)

    The dependencies are for the ortho version only. If you only want the diagonals, then everything is included as part of the model.
