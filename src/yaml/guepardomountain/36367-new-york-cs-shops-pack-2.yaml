  summary: New York CS$$ Shops Pack 2
  description: |-
    I enjoyed making my [first set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36323-new-york-cs-shops/) so much that I made some more!

    This download contains five 1x2 low-density (stage 3 for the corner lots, stage 2 for the others), medium-wealth growable commercial lots. Also includes a ploppable 5x2 landmark with all five buildings.

    They are inspired by wall-to-wall businesses in Brooklyn and Queens, and will grow on NY tileset only.
