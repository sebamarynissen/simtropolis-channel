  description: |-
    Vehicle repair/tire shop for low density commercial zones.

    Included is a 3x3 growable orthogonal lot, a 1x1 ploppable diagonal with just the building covering 1x1.5 diagonal tiles, and a 1x2 ploppable diagonal with an attached parking lot which covers 2x2 diagonal tiles. The version with the parking lot can only be placed on flat terrain.

    Each has 35 CS$$ jobs.

    Dependencies:

    The dependencies are for the ortho version only. If you only want the diagonals, then everything is included as part of the model.
