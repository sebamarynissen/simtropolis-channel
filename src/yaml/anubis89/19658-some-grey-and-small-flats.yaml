  summary: Some grey and small flats
  description: |-
    Something different from what I usually upload because it is not a civic building and it's **growable**. It looks quite simple, just a three storey building with grey walls...

    [click me to see another screenshot!](http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/6506/screen3backdayga1.jpg)

    Lot Size: 3x2, the building itself is almost 3 tiles long

    Capacity: 120 inhabitants

    Wealth: $

    Bulldoze Costs: 150$

    are there other important stats?

    Dependencies:

    **[SFBT Essentials](http://kurier.simcityplaza.de/details.php?file=5)** for the dumpsters in the front of the building

    also, as the sc4 tool tells me, **BSC Textures Vol 02**
