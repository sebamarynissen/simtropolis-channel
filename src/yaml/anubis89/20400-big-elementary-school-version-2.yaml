  summary: Big Elementary School Version 2
  description: |-
    This is a complete remake of my second bat. Because it is almost two years since its realese I have of course improved and that is why I made it.  It's not an exact replica, the appearance is slightly different from the old one, because I think it looks better that  way.

    **Stats:**

    Size: a 4x4 lot

    Capacity: 1000 students

    Radius: 1200

    Monthly Costs: 800 and 200

    Plop Cost: 300

    Bulldoze Cost: 150

    Provides 20$ and 5$ jobs

    \- Does not replace any other school!
