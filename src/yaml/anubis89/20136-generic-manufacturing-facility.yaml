    ***Update:*** Now includes a ploppable version and a readme, both done by patfirefghtr

    This building was thought as a generic, modern industrial facility. Though not actually intended as I-HT in the beginning I decided that the appearance suits I-HT pretty good.

    First of all - it is a growable, no ploppable version included since I do nor know how to make RCI\-ploppables...

    Capacity satisfied: 330

    Power needed: 50

    Water consumed: 35
