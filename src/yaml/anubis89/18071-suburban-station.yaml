  summary: Suburban Train Station
  description: |-
    I thinks there is a lack of smaller, normal looking suburban stations, which I use more than those big ones anyway. That's why I made this one.

    Lot size: 3x4

    Capacity: 2000 (like the ingame one)

    Monthly Costs: 10 ยง

    Plop Costs: 150 ยง

    **One Dependency:**

    Hope you like it!
