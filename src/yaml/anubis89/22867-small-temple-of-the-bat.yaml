  summary: Small Temple of the BAT
  description: |-
    A humble creation to honour the BAT that has crucially enhanced the life time period of SimCity 4. Perhaps SimCity is the game with the most custom content available, at least no other game comes to my mind.

    In the game the lot serves as a park.

    Lot Size: 1x1

    Plop Cost: 750 §

    Monthly Costs: 15 §

    \- No dependencies.
