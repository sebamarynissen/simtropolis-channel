  summary: Old Village Schools
  description: |-
    Well, after another batless year, here comes something new from me. Again civic, again fictional.

    This time there are two buildings, their only differences are textures and the lots they're on. Both are elementary schools and are inspired by local architecture.

    **Stats:**

    \- Lot Size: 2x3

    \- Capacity: 500

    \- Coverage Radius: 1000

    \- Monthly Costs: 300 (for the capacity) and 200 (for the coverage radius)

    \- Costs to build: 1000

    \- Bulldoze Costs: 400

    **Dependencies:**

    \- [https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex\_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180) (mostly the fences on one of the lots)

    As always, thanks to the Simforum members for their helpful advices.
