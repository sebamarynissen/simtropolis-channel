    5 growable lots and 1 massive ploppable lot for the commercial buildings I’ve done for the MSM series. Lot sizes vary in size between 1x2 to 2x3 or 3x2.

    The RR MSM Commercial Models ARE REQUIRED for both the prop and lot files included with this download to work correctly. I separated the two due to the amount of files.

    As part of the RR MSM (Modular Strip Mall) series of buildings, these buildings are designed to fit all together by use of props to create a shopping commercial complex for your neighborhood. I highly recommend you customize the lots to your liking if you wish to do so. The included props are of the MSM Commercial Model buildings found in the dependency list below.

    If you don’t want any individual lots, make sure to delete the lots folder. You can also ignore the dependency list for lot use below.
