  summary: Kroger Marketplace Brands
  description: |-
    The Kroger company is the largest supermarket chain in the United States. As such, it operates under many different banners in parts of the country. What I’ve done here is made a Kroger Marketplace as the base model and simply swapped logos to represent Kroger’s 5 banners (Kroger, King Soopers, Dillon’s, Smith’s & Fry’s) that use the marketplace format. The marketplace format for all five banners is the typical supermarket combined with other departments such as toys, apparel, home goods and more.

    You can choose which of the five you would like to keep by simply deleting the other folders. You could technically keep all five, but I don’t recommend it since the buildings are intentionally designed to be same.

    All five lots are 12x12 in size and all come with 926 jobs. All five lots share the same dependencies.
