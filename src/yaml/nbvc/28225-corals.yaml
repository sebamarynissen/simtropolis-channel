    The file contains corals for mayor menu.

    There are two folders in the zip file one with single corals and one with larger groups of corals you can copy all or only those folders you like in your plugin folder.

    You can change the corals with additional clicks on the same coral.

    The corals can also be used as props in the Lot-Editor for your custom lots.
