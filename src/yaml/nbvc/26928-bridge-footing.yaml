  summary: Bridge Footing
  description: |-
    Two eye candy Lots for bridges. You can place the footing on your bridges or where ever you want. The file contains a concrete version and a mossy version.

    To plop them you can switch to "Water Pollution" View and place them like it is shown in the last image.

    The Lots are located in the miscellaneous transportation menu.

    No dependencies.
