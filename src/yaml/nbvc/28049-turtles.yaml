    The file contains different turtles. It contains mayor menu ploppable turtles and three Lots with turtles which are swimming on the water surface. The Lots are in the seaport menu.

    You can change the MMP turtles with additional clicks on the same turtle. Some of the MMP turtles are made to swim underwater, they will swim at a fixed high about the ground. Be careful with the swimming turtles, if you place them on land, it will look like flying turtles. ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)

    The turtles are not animated.

    The Lots and MMPs are in different folders and you can copy all or only those folders you like in your plugin folder.

    The turtles can also be used as props in the Lot-Editor for your custom lots.

    No dependencies.
