  summary: Ill Tonkso Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my third BAT stadium, a medium sized football ground which, as the others do, offers an in-between stage between field and minor league stadium as well as general football ground variation. It's several BATted objects around the original in-game pitch.

    The ground is named after and dedicated to Ill Tonkso, my favourite BATter, who has made some fantastic replications of buildings in my hometown, Portsmouth. The stands and floodlights are not based on any real ground, but are in general influenced by British non-league football.

    Some stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 4000

    \* Monthly Cost = 125

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 350

    \* Power Consumed = 80

    \* Water Consumed = 300

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
