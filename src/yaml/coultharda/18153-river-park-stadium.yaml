  summary: River Park Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my latest stadium, 'River Park Stadium'. The design of the stadium is inspired by the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, but as with all my stadiums based on something real-life, it's not completely accurate to its counterpart. The ground is suitable for larger semi-professional or small professional football teams, and perhaps even the national team of a small nation.

    Stats

    \* Plop Cost = 7500

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 250

    \* Power Consumed = 150

    \* Water Consumed = 150

    \* Pollution = V.low garbage.

    \* Lot size = 5x6

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way.
