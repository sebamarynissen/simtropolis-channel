  summary: Sobcitski Stadium
  description: |-
    This is the latest of my stadium BATs, a smaller one than last time, geared towards being compact, so it can fit into resdential areas and the like, without taking up too much space. It's all seated, with the seats being in blue. Both ends have a few letter on, as many football stands do, to live them up a bit.

    Excuse the awful name by the way. I'm uninspired at the moment.

    Stats

    \* Plop Cost = 3500

    \* Monthly Cost = 30

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 250

    \* Power Consumed = 150

    \* Water Consumed = 175

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
