  summary: Small Football Ground 3
  description: |-
    This is the next in my series of small (association) football grounds. The stand here is based on that at Sportplatz Blumenau in Triesen, Liechtenstein. The intention of this ground is to give something more than just a football pitch if you want a small team in your SC4 town or village.

    The lot is 3x5 but the stand overhangs. This is done, as the stand is so small it seemed a waste to make it take up 5 extra tiles. I have used grass filler lots under the stand in my screenshots to make it flow better with the pitch next to it.

    The pitch is intentionally not floodlit at night, as neither is Sportplatz Blumenau.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 550

    Maintenance Cost= 40

    Bulldoze Cost= 100

    Power Consumed= 10

    Water Consumed= 20

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
