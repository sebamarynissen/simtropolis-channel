  summary: All Weather Hockey and Football Pitch
  description: |-
    Okay, so it's been a while (3 years), but I've come back to BAT to try and finish off some old projects. First up is this astroturf pitch. It has markings for both field hockey (in white) and association football (in yellow) as is reasonably common for these types of pitches. In this case, hockey goals are in place.

    The lot is 3x5, the same as the Maxis soccer field. It has nightlighting as evidenced in the screenshot.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 400

    Maintenance Cost= 30

    Bulldoze Cost= 150

    Power Consumed= 10

    Any problems, post in the comments, or PM me. I don't play SC4 any more, so haven't been able to rigorously test this.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way

    PS. Hockey and football in the title refer to the British meanings of those words. If you're American and don't like that, get over it ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)
