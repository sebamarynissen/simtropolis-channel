  summary: Dixon Kennedy Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my latest, and to date, largest BAT. It's an athletics and football stadium, based on no particular real-life ground. It is mainly terraces, but with a small seated section under the roof.

    It's named after Mike Dixon-Kennedy, an author, who goes by the alias of onlyplace4 on this site. He helped me out of a hole in this project and the name shows my gratitude.

    Stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 12000

    \* Monthly Cost = 150

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 500

    \* Power Consumed = 500

    \* Water Consumed = 200

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    Edited at 17:12 BST- Pitch texture changed

    I hope somebody finds this useful in some way, thanks.

    PS. If you like this kind of stadium, then I recommend 'MK Stadium', upoaded a while ago on the STEX (If you don't have it already).
