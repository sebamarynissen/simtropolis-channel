  summary: Small Football Ground
  description: |-
    This is a small amateur football ground with a single stand and small clubhouse. It is based loosely upon Sportanlage Eselriet, a ground in Switzerland, but some details were altered for ease of BATting and to look better in game. The intention of this ground is to give something more than just a football pitch if you want a small team in your SC4 town or village.

    The lot is 3x5 but the stand overhangs. This is done, as the stand is so small it seemed a waste to make it take up 5 extra tiles. I have used grass filler lots under the stand in my screenshots to make it flow better with the pitch next to it.

    Note, that floodlights were intentionally omitted, as the ground this was based on has none, as is the case in many grounds of this size.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 500

    Maintenance Cost= 40

    Bulldoze Cost= 100

    Power Consumed= 10

    Water Consumed= 20

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way

    NB: Originally this was going to be released with another similar ground, but finishing the other is becoming bothersome, so I've moved onto another project and so felt I should release this now rather than a while in the future.
