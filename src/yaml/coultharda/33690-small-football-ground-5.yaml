  summary: Small Football Ground 5
  description: |-
    I found myself reinstalling SimCity 4 during lockdown and whilst digging out my old plugins, I have found a handful of nearly complete BATs from many years ago, when I used to be more active. This is one of those. Whilst it's not 100% the final product I had originally intended (hence, it was never released), I think it's good enough to share in the hope that somebody finds it useful in some way.

    This is the next (and almost certainly final) in my series of small (association) football grounds. The stand here is based on one at Colovray Sports Centre in Nyon, Switzerland. The intention of this ground is to give something more than just a football pitch if you want a small team in your SC4 town or village.

    The lot is 3x5 but the stand overhangs. This is done, as the stand is relatively small so it seemed a waste to make it take up 5 extra tiles. You could put small car parks in the corner, or whatever takes your fancy.

    The stand itself has no nightlights, but the pitch is lit up with the base game soccer field lighting. The base game soccer field players are also present.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 700

    Maintenance Cost= 50

    Bulldoze Cost= 125

    Power Consumed= 10

    Water Consumed= 20

    No dependencies
