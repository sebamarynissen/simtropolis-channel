  summary: All Weather Pitch
  description: |-
    This is my sixth sports BAT, and I have gone for someting slightly different, an all-weather pitch suitable for both hockey and football (although it has hockey goals set up in the BAT).

    The stand is based off one from a previous BAT, with the colours changed to make it more like the real-life stand it was based on. The pitch is common of many sites around the country.

    Some stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 2000

    \* Monthly Cost = 50

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 200

    \* Power Consumed = 100

    \* Water Consumed = 200

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
