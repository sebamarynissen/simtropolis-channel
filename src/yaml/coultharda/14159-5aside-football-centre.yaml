  summary: 5aside football centre
  description: |-
    This is a 5-a-side football centre (very loosely based on ROKO in Portsmouth), which has 4 cages and ample parking.

    This is my first addition to this site, and the lot does have a mistake in that it is labelled as a plaza (but once it's plopped you can just change that).

    It costs
