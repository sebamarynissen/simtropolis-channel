  summary: Small Football Ground 4
  description: |-
    This is the newest in my series of small association football grounds. They are aimed at giving variety in football teams for small SC4 towns or villages. This one, based on a stand at Centre Sportif de Varemb√© in Geneva, Switzerland (*based on*, not absolutely true to life) is combined changing room/stand, the pitch lit at night by floodlights on each corner.

    Unlike the other three grounds I've made in this series, the Lot does not overhang here. It is simply a 5x4 Lot, with parking behind the stand.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 700

    Maintenance Cost= 50

    Bulldoze Cost= 125

    Power Consumed= 10

    Water Consumed= 20

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
