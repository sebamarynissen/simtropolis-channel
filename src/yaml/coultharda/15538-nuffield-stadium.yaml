  summary: Nuffield Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my fourth BAT stadium, a small, single-stand football ground which, as the others do, offers an in-between stage between field and minor league stadium as well as general football ground variation. It's several BATted objects around the original in-game pitch.

    The stand is **very loosely** based around one at Burnaby Road (HMS Temeraire), Portsmouth, UK. It's an old project of mine, which looked set to be chucked away, but I modified it into this, something which I think looks good enough.

    Some stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 900

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 200

    \* Power Consumed = 90

    \* Water Consumed = 250

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
