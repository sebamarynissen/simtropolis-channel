  description: |-
    This is the latest of my stadium BATs, a small one (only three sides), which is a bit simpler than my last couple of larger or all-seated stadiums. It's mainly a terraced ground, with some seating at the back of the main stand. It's a smallish lot, just 6x4 and so should fit in well without the need to clear a large space.

    Dedicated to the funky people who hang out in chat all day. One of you even gave me the name for the ground. Remind me if it was you (I have an awful memory for names) and I'll credit you specifically.

    Stats

    \* Plop Cost = 2500

    \* Monthly Cost = 70

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 250

    \* Power Consumed = 150

    \* Water Consumed = 100

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
