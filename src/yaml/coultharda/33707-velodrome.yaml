  summary: Velodrome
  description: |-
    I found myself reinstalling SimCity 4 during lockdown and whilst digging out my old plugins, I have found a handful of nearly complete BATs from many years ago, when I used to be more active. This is one of those. Whilst it's not 100% the final product I had originally intended (I was never happy with the lot surrounding the main structure, or the nightlighting), I think it's good enough to share in the hope that somebody finds it useful in some way.

    This is a velodrome, based on the velodrome in Athens used in the 2004 Summer Olympics. There's no obvious cycle references though, so you can use your imagination and pretend all sorts of things could be under the roof.

    The velodrome has nightlights, as shown in the screenshots.

    Stats:

    No dependencies.
