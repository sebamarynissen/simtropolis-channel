  summary: David Collett Stadium
  description: |-
    This is a bit different form my current series of BATs, but it's an old model which I found the time to finish to an acceptable (in my eyes) level. It's another medium sized stadium, similar in that respect to my previous release 'Generic Modern UK Stadium'.

    This stadium is fictional, named after the man who my University Hall of Residence is named after (I was low on inspiration). The roof support design is the only bit really influenced by a specific stadium, it being based on that at the Reebok Stadium, Bolton.

    Stats

    \* Plop Cost = 20000

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 500

    \* Power Consumed = 45

    \* Water Consumed = 20

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    \* Lot size = 8x6

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way.
