  summary: Small Football Stadium
  description: |-
    I found myself reinstalling SimCity 4 during lockdown and whilst digging out my old plugins, I have found a handful of nearly complete BATs from many years ago, when I used to be more active. This is one of those. Whilst it's not 100% the final product I had originally intended (personally, I think this stadium is a bit too *grey*), I think it's good enough to share in the hope that somebody finds it useful in some way.

    This is a small sized stadium based on Stadion Br√ºhl in Grenchen, Switzerland. Yesterday I uploaded the same BAT but with a rugby pitch layout; this has a football pitch, the sport usually played at the real-life stadium.

    The pitch has nightlights, as shown in the screenshots.

    Stats:

    Size= 5x7

    Build Cost= 5000

    Maintenance Cost= 100

    Bulldoze Cost= 500

    Power Consumed= 100

    Water Consumed= 50

    No dependencies.
