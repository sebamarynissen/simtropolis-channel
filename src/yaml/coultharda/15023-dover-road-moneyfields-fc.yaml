  summary: Dover Road Moneyfields FC
  description: |-
    Please bear in mind that this is my 1st BAT.

    I made it for myself, and thought that someone out there may also wish to use, so I thought, why not upload it? I'm well aware that it's not perfect, and if you don't like it, please offer constructive criticism.

    It's based around Dover Road, in Portsmough (UK), home to Moneyfields FC. It's several BATted objects, positioned, around the in-game football (soccer) pitch, to create a very small football ground (something I felt the STEX lacked).

    Some Stats:

    -   Plop Cost = 1000
    -   Monthly Cost = 90
    -   Bulldoze Cost = 150
    -   Power Consumed = 80
    -   Water Consumed = 200
    -   Pollution = V. low water pollution, and garbage.

    There are limited night-lights, but in real-life the place is pretty much pitch black at night.

    No dependencies.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
