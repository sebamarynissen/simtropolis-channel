  summary: Generic Modern UK Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my latest BAT, 'Generic Modern UK Stadium'. It's based upon the general design of a lot of newer football stadiums in the UK, with the supporting sticks coming from the roof, and one large, all-seated bowl for fans. The floodlights are along the edge of the roof.

    Stats

    \* Plop Cost = 20000

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 400

    \* Power Consumed = 45

    \* Water Consumed = 20

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    \* Lot size = 8x6

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way.
