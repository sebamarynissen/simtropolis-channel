  summary: Small Athletics and Football Ground
  description: |-
    This is my latest BAT, similar in a way to my recent Small Football Ground series, yet with the clear diffference of being combined athletics and association football ground, something common across Europe. The stand is based upon that at Stadion Trinermatten in Zofingen, Switzerland, although track layout is based on another location.

    The BAT has nitelites as shown, and is on a 9x6 Lot with parking down one side. I have left it devoid of trees intentionally, so the user may place trees (in game or in LE) depending on what type they use.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 2400

    Maintenance Cost= 100

    Bulldoze Cost= 200

    Power Consumed= 50

    Water Consumed= 50

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
