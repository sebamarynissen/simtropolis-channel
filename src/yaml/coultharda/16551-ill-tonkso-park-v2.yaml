  summary: Ill Tonkso Park V2
  description: |-
    This is a rework of my third BAT stadium, a medium sized football ground which offers an in-between stage between field and minor league stadium as well as general football ground variation. The original I felt was let down by the fact that it was using the original in-game pitch, and also that it didn't have a tunnel to in-stand dressing rooms. I therefore majorly edited one stand and replaced another, as well as placing it all around a BATted football pitch, to make the lot easier.

    The ground is still named after and dedicated to Ill Tonkso, my favourite BATter, who has made some fantastic replications of buildings in my hometown, Portsmouth. The stands and floodlights are not based on any real ground, but are in general influenced by British non-league football.

    Some stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 6000

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 250

    \* Power Consumed = 300

    \* Water Consumed = 300

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
