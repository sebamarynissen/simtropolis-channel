  summary: Victory Stadium
  description: |-
    This is my second BAT stadium, another small one-stand ground to make a step between plain field, and minor league stadium. It's a few BATted objects around the original in-game pitch.

    The stand is based around one on an atheletics track at Burnaby Road (HMS Temeraire), Portsmouth (UK), and is also from where the name came.

    Some stats:

    \* Plop Cost = 1250

    \* Monthly Cost = 100

    \* Bulldoze Cost = 250

    \* Power Consumed = 100

    \* Water Consumed = 250

    \* Pollution = V.low water pollution, and garbage.

    There are limited night-lights, but in real-life football grounds aren't lit up at night (so that's my excuse).

    Updated 24/03: Night-lights added.

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way. Thanks.
