  summary: Small Football Ground 2
  description: |-
    This is the next in my series of small football grounds. It is based upon Stade Leon-Burrus in Boncourt, Switzerland, but some details were altered for ease of BATting and to look better in game. The ground consists of a stand/clubhouse merged together and an iron railing around the pitch. The intention of this ground is to give something more than just a football pitch if you want a small team in your SC4 town or village.

    The lot is 3x5 but the stand overhangs. This is done, as the stand is so small it seemed a waste to make it take up 5 extra tiles. I have used grass filler lots under the stand in my screenshots to make it flow better with the pitch next to it.

    The pitch is floodlit at night, as in the real life ground this is based upon.

    Stats:

    Build Cost= 600

    Maintenance Cost= 40

    Bulldoze Cost= 100

    Power Consumed= 10

    Water Consumed= 20

    I hope someone finds this useful in some way
