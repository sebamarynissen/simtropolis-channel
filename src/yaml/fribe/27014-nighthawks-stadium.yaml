  summary: Nighthawks Stadium
  description: |-
    Here's a mid-sized football stadium for a university or sports complex area. The minor league Omaha Nighthawks were used for the namesake and logo, but this is a completely fictional stadium. Been a while since I tried this, but I think I got all of the kinks out, though I'm not too happy with how the bricks were rendered.

    Appears in Landmarks, costs $30,000 to plop, no dependencies.
