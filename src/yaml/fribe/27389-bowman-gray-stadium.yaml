  summary: Bowman Gray Stadium
  description: |-
    Bowman Gray Stadium, built in 1949 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is one of the rare remaining dual purpose stadiums that hosts both football and motorsports. Though the football field in the center draws attention, it's actually the quarter-mile asphalt track ringing it that brings the stadium its legendary lore. This small circuit was one of the cornerstones of the early days of NASCAR, and has hosted races at one level or another for over 60 years, continuing to this day, with racing running weekly. The football gridiron laid out in the infield was once host to the team from Wake Forest University, but today is utilized by Winston-Salem State University's team.
