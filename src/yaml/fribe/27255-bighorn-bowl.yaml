  description: |-
    The Bighorn Bowl football stadium is finally finished! Er, is it? Didn't they build that thing back in the 40s? I don't care how many times you "renovate" it, it's a terrible place to focus on a game. Look at those seats, they aren't even close to the playing field! How many more years are the alumni and boosters going to pay for these new coats of paint before someone finally gives and pushes forward a new stadium for the school?

    Fictional stadium based off of the generic bowl mold that many college football stadiums came out of back in the day. Was supposed to be symmetrical, with an upper deck on the opposite side, but there wasn't enough memory space to complete it. Should I figure out the problems, I'll release the expanded version of the stadium.

    Appears under Landmarks, lot size is 10x13...
