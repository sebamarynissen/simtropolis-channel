  summary: Arctic Circle Ice Cream
  description: |-
    CS$$ Roadside snack shop and dairy, in the old-fashioned Drive-In style. Based off of a real store in northern Maryland.

    Growable only, creates 9 CS$$ jobs, no dependencies

    In-game textures are a bit bright, but in actuality, so is the real building. Sometimes things are meant to be pastel!
