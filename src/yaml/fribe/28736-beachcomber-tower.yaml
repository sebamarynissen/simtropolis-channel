  summary: Beachcomber Tower
  description: |-
    A waterfront condominium and vacation rental complex, meant to be placed snug up against the beach or harbor. Designed with an open garage level, these buildings don't have to worry about flooding during storms and other inland water surges. Modeled after complexes up and down the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic US.

    (And hey, look at that, I can build something other than a stadium)

    Lot size: 4x2

    Provides R$$146

    Also available as a ploppable Landmark, also 4x2 in size, costs $8000 to drop

    No dependencies! Have fun with it!
