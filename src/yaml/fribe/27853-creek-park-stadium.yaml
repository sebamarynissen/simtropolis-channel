  summary: Creek Park Stadium
  description: |-
    A step back in time...to an example of a retro/art-deco style community stadium of the WPA era. Though not based on any one ballpark in particular, dozens of these small stadiums existed at one time throughout the US, typically built in the 1930s-1940s in similar styles. Some have been historically preserved and still see games and action today, often utilizing the stadium's dimensions for other sports. Creek Park would be an example of one of those, set within a residential or park district of a town, location and standards to what would have been acceptable at the time, but wouldn't be granted a new team today.
