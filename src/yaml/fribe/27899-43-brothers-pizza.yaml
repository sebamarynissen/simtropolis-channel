  summary: 43 Brothers Pizza
  description: |-
    The only thing the Toppingopolous family does better than produce sons is produce quality Italian take-out. Designed (and spoofing) the endless pizza/pasta/Italian/Greek family owned joints on the East Coast, the building is designed to be placed or grow in wall-to-wall, Main Street or business strip areas.

    Size: 1x3

    Ploppable Landmark (No Jobs)

    Growable, 11 CS$$

    No dependencies

    Done somewhat to show that I actually can build - no matter how basic - things other than stadiums. I felt like I could use lots like these for my small towns, hopefully you can too!
