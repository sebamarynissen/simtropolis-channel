  summary: Mallow Park
  description: |-
    Mid-sized pro baseball stadium, built in the "retro" brick and steel style template that many of the stadiums constructed post-1990 have used. Elements are borrowed from a few real stadiums, but this is a fictional park.

    Appears under Landmarks

    Cost: $34000

    Size: 11x12

    Dependencies: None!

    I actually work at a baseball stadium, so I think I've nailed down a few of the elements that go into a good park.

    I've also got a game for you, a riddle or puzzle hunt that you can go attack.

    The main gate area of the stadium's exterior, front and center, *is modeled after a stadium that doesn't exist*. Tell me what city I'd find this stadium in - if it did exist - and you win the naming rights to the next SC4 stadium that I build. Either message me or post it in the comments section here if you have a guess or manage to find the right answer. I don't expect anyone to win, though.

    **SimCoug was the first to get it - proposed stadium in Virginia Beach**
