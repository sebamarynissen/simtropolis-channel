  summary: Hemphill Place
  description: |-
    Hemphill Place is my first residential BAT. Built from a scramble of a few existing buildings, I designed it in the "new" retro style of some upscale suburban and large town condominium or apartment blocks, but would also work in a city, or a remote resort area.

    Two lots included:

    3x3 Growable R$$ 105

    2x3 Landmark Ploppable

    No dependencies, no nothing else.

    *(No nightlighting, I still can't get them to work right, and I don't play at night. If anyone wants to retrofit the model, that'd be fine with me)*
