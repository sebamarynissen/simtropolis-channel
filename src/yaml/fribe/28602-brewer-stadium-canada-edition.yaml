  summary: Brewer Stadium (Canada Edition)
  description: |-
    Here's something for our friends to the north. Expansion pack stadium, where the original football gridiron is expanded to the Canadian Rules format. Nearly identical to American Football, the Canadian game - and the Canadian Football League - features a few minor rule changes, plus a field wider and longer. The original Brewer Stadium is included with a Canadian layout, and I've also included a stripped-down version of it that's smaller in size, something for a Canadian university team.

    Lot sizes are 11x11 or 8x9, are both found under Landmarks, and contain no dependencies. This won't replace the original Brewer Stadium if you have it.

    (And I'll be darned, trying to type "Brewer" quickly is giving me fits - I gotta work on these names!)
