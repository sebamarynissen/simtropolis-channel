  summary: Brewer Stadium
  description: |-
    Here's a new (or old) football stadium for your college campus. And what American university would be complete with this centerpiece of both student life, alumni bragging rights, free labor, and elaborate booster controversies? Designed after a variety of different real-life stadiums, not one in particular. Appears under Landmarks, costs $30000 to plop, takes up a 11x11 lot space, and has no dependencies.
