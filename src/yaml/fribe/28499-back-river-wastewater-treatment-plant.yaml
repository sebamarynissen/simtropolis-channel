  summary: Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant
  description: |-
    Out of town motorists driving around the Baltimore Beltway might notice the stark, strange golden towers on a wooded hilltop just outside of Dundalk, and wonder what the attraction is; a monument? A weird casino? Grain elevator, something industrial? You'd be getting warmer. Locals have their own names for the infamous golden domes, or golden eggs, whose identity as a sewage treatment isn't the most glamorous (or pleasantly smelling) attraction a visitor would hope for.

    The 150+ foot towers stabilize the bacteria in the sludge passed through the plant, holding several million gallons of solid waste, and were completed in 1992.

    My lot is 5x5, and serves as a Water Treatment center. It also slightly decreases pollution in the area.
