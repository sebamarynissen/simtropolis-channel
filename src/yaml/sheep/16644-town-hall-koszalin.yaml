    Koszalin Town Hall

    * * *

    As you already read it's a Town Hall from Koszalin, the city in Poland near to the Baltic Sea. It has been re-painted many times, so I'm not even sure how does it look like at the moment. But matter of fact any paint will hide it's unique, square shape ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif) There's a plaza in front of this building with [The Forgotten Rebels Memorial](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=16643), and fountain. It can be downloaded from the STEX as well.

    It's just a simple landmark - there's nothing functional. That's the result of SC4Tool breaking down every time I try to turn it on. If I learn how to make a functional landmarks without this application, I'll update it.
