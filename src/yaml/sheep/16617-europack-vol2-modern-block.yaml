    **Europack vol.2: Modern Blocks**

    * * *

    Here's a new release of european style buildings. This edition contains one tripple modern building inspired by architecture of Koszalin, the city where I live. It's a characteristic, slender block with parking and garages at the back. It has nightlights, but I can't show how does it look ingame, cause I'm unable to install patch from Maxis which fixes the nightlight issue.

    I've also updated today the older, first part of the Europack: the problem with too saturated rooftiles has been fixed, and the nightlights have been added too. You can download updated version [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=16392)
