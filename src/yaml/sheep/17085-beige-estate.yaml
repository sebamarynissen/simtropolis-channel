    Beige Estate v.1.0

    * * *

    That's the result of my latest attempt to do a non-european style bulding. It's modeled after a photo which I found by an accident when I was surfing (it's above). Unfortunatelly I can't tell you where this bulding exactly is, but I bet somewhere in the north America.

    It's a simple high wealth residential block. It has 16 floors, and the swimming pool on the uppest one. It can be visible as the light is turned on. As you can see, there are many balconies. What else can I say? Hope you'll like this building and download it. Sorry for 'very original' name of it, but I couldn't invent anything better.
