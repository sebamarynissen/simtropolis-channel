    The Forgotten Rebels Memorial

    * * *

    This monument is a tribute to everyone who defended his country during the WWII. At least I think so. It is based on a real one in Koszalin, the city which I'm going to copy into SimCity ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif) It has one writing on each side: we were, we are, we will be. But you can treat it just like an interesting (or not) detail, cause it's even too small to be readable.

    Although I usually make building for european cities, I think it can be used for both, european and american. It is placed in parks menu. You can find there 2 versions: 2x2, which is showed in the screenshot, and 1x1 as a little bonus. Stats are the same. The additional prop visible on the screenshot, fountain, is also included.
