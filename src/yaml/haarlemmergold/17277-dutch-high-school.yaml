  description: |-
    High School, 1x2, ploppable, inc nighttextures **and new lot**\- This building can be used as a high school, but could serve as an excellent town hall (gemeentehuis) for small towns as well if lotted otherwise...  There where a few problems with the lot. I made a new one - hope this one works...
