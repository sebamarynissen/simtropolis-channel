  summary: SC Golf pack
  description: |-
    This is a collection of lots based off of joerg's Golf Pack that you can use to create your own custom golf course.

    With joerg's permission I have recreated most of his golf pack lots with lower plop costs and monthly fees. This will enable you to create sprawling a sprawling golf course at a fraction of the cost.

    Most monthly fees range between $20-50 a month for the major lots, while the filler tiles, paths and parking lots will only cost you $1 a month. Plop costs now range from $1000-5000 depending on the size of the lot for major lots, while the filler tiles and paths only cost $50.

    The most noticable difference is the clubhouse, which will now replace your country club reward lot. This lot was inspired by joerg's swimming pool, tennis court, and putting green lots that were included in his golf pack. All are combined into the 12x12 country club reward.

    Enjoy!

    This is my first lot upload so let me know if I did something wrong.
