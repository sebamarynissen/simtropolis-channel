  summary: Arthur Berkhardt Expressway Project
  warning: "As the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway is an American highway, Euro textures are excluded for realism purposes"
  description: |-
     Tarkusian Moddage, in association with Kramerica Industries, is proud to bring you Version 4.0 of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway Project, or ABEP. ABEP will transform your RHW-8S networks into special "wide lane" RHW-4s, perfect for luxurious freeway driving (as seen in the Seinfeld episode "The Pothole")!
     
     ABEP converts the RHW-8S network, including its Level 1 (7.5m) and Level 2 (15m) elevated versions, to the RHW-4LL (LL=Luxury Lane).  Limited support is included for RHW-10S conversion to RHW-5.5LL.  Version 4 adds support for converting the RHW-12S to the RHW-6LL--just one more (luxury) lane!
