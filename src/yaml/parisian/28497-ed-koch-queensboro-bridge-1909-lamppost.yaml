  summary: Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge 1909 Lamppost
  description: |-
    This lamppost originally placed in 1909 used to have a twin on the other side of the New York Ed Koch bridge entrance. That lamppost vanished in the 1970s, but no one knew what had happened to it until it was found in a Department of Transportation signal yard in Queens last year.

    The Roosevelt Island Historical Society plans to restore it and display it there again.
