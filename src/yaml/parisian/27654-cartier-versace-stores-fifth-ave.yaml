  summary: Cartier + Versace Stores (Fifth Ave)
  description: |-
    A first version has been uploaded few years ago, this is the 2nde one with nitelite and a little smaller than the V1 model. The neighbour building part of the Cartier Store has been added (a part that didn't exist in V1).

    This building is an iconic old building located at 651 Fifth Avenue, close to St Patrick cathedral.

    In 1970, the Landmarks Preservation Commission filed a proposal that the building become known as a New York City Landmark.

    In June 2003, the City of New York renamed the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street « Place de Cartier », thus opening a new chapter in the long love story linking Cartier to New York. (source www.cartier.com)

    Have fun.
