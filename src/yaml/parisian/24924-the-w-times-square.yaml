  summary: The W Times Square
  description: |-
    This Building is located in Times Square on Broadway, between Morgan Stanley Tower and Mariott Marquis Hotel. This is a 53 Stories tower hotel to place in your SimTimesSquare or wherever you want.

    This building works as a Landmark, and is a 4X4 lot.

    A nightlighting exists, but is not very realistic. I will make as soon as possible a new nightlighting which will show all commercials like in RL Times Square by night.

    Enjoy ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
