  summary: Gotham Style monumental lights
  description: |-
    I did that for my own use and decided to upload it.

    It is just a little lot to customize your sim avenues, bridges or tunnels entrances or whatever you want. I did that to ornate my Queensboro Bridge (Manhattan side) entrances. It is what I could call a "Gotham Style" monumental light. I precise I have been "inspired" by those at the entrance of the real Queensborobridge. This is absolutely not a reproduction. That the reason why I upload it under my own name and not the "NYBT".

    \*Item plop cost : 50 000

    \*Landmark : Yes

    \*Effect : Medium Wealth

    \*Size : 1X1

    \*Nightlight : Yes

    Enjoy
