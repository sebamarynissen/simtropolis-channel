  summary: Paramount Appartments Tower
  description: |-
    This tower is a luxury condominium complex built in 1998 located in Murray Hill/Manhattan, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and 38th/39th St.

    This building appears as a landmark (sorry) and has for now no nightlighting. I will try my best to be able to render a nitelite version soon. It is a 2X4 surface building.
