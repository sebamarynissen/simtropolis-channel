  summary: Sahara Terrain Mod
  description: |-
    Here I present my Sahara terrain mod. This mod (I personally think) is unfinished due to lack of work and textures, but I decided to upload it because I'm unsure If I'd ever complete it and I hope someone may make use of it.

    This mod replaces your terrain with soft sandy textures representing a vast dry desert, dunes poking out of the summer haze.

    This mod has no dependencies, and contains 2 of my other mods, the `pkg=marsh:sphinx-rock-mod`, and the `pkg=marsh:white-gravel-beach-mod`. These 2 dat. files are optional. All other files included in the download are required in order for the soft sand heated by endless summer suns to appear.
