    **\[HD\]Riverside Beach Mod** - *Textures by kodlavag*

    Installation-

    Simply unzip into your plugins folder. Make sure there are no other beach mods as to not conflict with this one.

    Recommendations-

    I used PEG's Brigantine water mod in the pics. I, however, have not tried many other ones. So feel free to use your own.

    Description-

    This is a mod which replaces all your beaches with a tanish gravely texture, and then a darker brown texture for a muddyish water. It is also HD, and differs from other beach textures which are just plain flat.
