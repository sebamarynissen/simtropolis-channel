  summary: Larger Cul-de-sac Mod
  description: |-
    **THERE IS STILL AN ISSUE NOT SHOWING MAXIS TEXTURES IN ZONED AREAS. SAM STREETS WORK HOWEVER.**

    **Larger Cul-de-sac Mod**  
      
    This mod changes the NAM street roundabouts and 4 SAM streets into large cul-de-sac's for suburban areas of cities.  
      
    Install:  
    Place the entire "z\_\_\_Larger Cul-de-sac mod" folder into your "C:/My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins" folder  
    DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER OR PLACE IN ANY SUB-FOLDER. The z\_ is required for it to load correctly.  
      
    Dependencies:  
    [NAM](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=851) is required.

    Thanks to Bryan1998 for helping on SAM textures, Metalpuritan and Magneto, for finding solutions to past compatibility problems, and thanks to Spinmaster for the request.
