  summary: Ormen L책nge
  description: |-
    This is a residential building from the Swedish village of Svappavaara. It was designed by Ralph Erskine, who also designed the block "ortdrivaren" rough translating to miner cave builder (bad translation but hey). He also designed Shopping which is a shopping mall in my home town, in fact the fist indoor shopping center in the world. Ormen L책nge got its name from a Viking ship found in Norway.
