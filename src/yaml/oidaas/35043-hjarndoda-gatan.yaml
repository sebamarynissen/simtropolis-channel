    **About**

    Ah what would a town be without a modernistic fugly office.  
    This particular office is modelled after a office that replaced a whole block of elderly structures from the 1800's to the 1930's.  
    The name Hjarndoda gatan is translated as "braindead street", perhaps from its design or the sims who works there, the song wind up working at a gas station comes to mind :-p.  
    talking about songs there is a song i Sweden called "Lyckliga gatan" that describes the demolition of old blocks in the favour of 60's to 70's architecture.  
    Anyhow, enough drabble.
