  summary: French Connections Luxury Paths Expansion Pack
  description: |-
    Add even more style and flair to your cities, with this expansion pack for the Luxury tree lined paths from BLaM French Connections.

    Pack contains additional 1 x 1 lots with custom icons, that connect together in a variety of ways, enabling you to create beautiful walkways through your residential and/or business districts. Used in conjunction with the French Connections Modular Flowerbeds, you can create your own secluded gardens of any size or shape you desire. The design is limited only by your own imagination !

    dependencies

    This pack will work perfectly well as a stand alone pack, but is designed primarily as an expansion to the BLaM FC Luxury Paths, and as such requires no further dependencies.

    If you wish however to use it without the main pack, it will require the following dependencies

    BLaM French Connections Mega Pack 1

    BLaM Essentials

    To instal

    BLaM recommends the making of a folder named BLaM within your plugins folder. The contents of the folder contained within the download zip archive may then be dragged directly to that folder.

    WARNING - If you have files in your plugins folder that use incorrect texture ID's, this could cause conflicts
