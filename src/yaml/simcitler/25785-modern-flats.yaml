    Installation:

    just unzip the files into your Plugins folder!

    Due to the fact that i created new \*.SC4DESC files for these lots, there should be no conflicts with the original lots by sheep.

    Credits go to:

    sheep, for his great BAT.

    Another Thank you to various members of the BSC Team for their Texture creations, and to all creators of props used on the lots!

    special thanks to the simforum community for their advice and help.

    Hope you like!
