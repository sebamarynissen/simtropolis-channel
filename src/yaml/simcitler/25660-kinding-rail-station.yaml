#     ***Kinding rail station***

#     After half an year i managed to solve a texture problem that might occur under certain circumstances.  The problem was that i lotted this station with an outdated version of north country dude´s rail textures. (which I realised today ![:lol:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaLol.gif))

#     I fixed it and now everyone should be able to see the track textures correctly.

#     Version 2 additionally features:

#     -     
           
        
#     -   a new custom icon  
        
#     -   german LTEXTs  
        
#     -   Transit Switch Entry Cost reduced to 0,025 (former 0,075)  
        

#     \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#     Kinding rail station is a fully functional 4 track passenger rail station with 2 platforms, providing a capacity of 7.500, bus functionality and TE parking lots.

#     Depending on daytime, two different trains (timed props) will "stop" at one of the platforms!
