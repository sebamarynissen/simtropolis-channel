    **szymcar apartments**  

      
    This Lot pack contains six (growable) residential lots using BATs made by szymcar!  
    Due to a lack of R$$ lots for my own projects i decided to give these nice BAT´s (3 different colours) a new home.  
      
    Included are 6 different lots (two 3x3; two 5x4; two 5x5) which contain either 1, 2 or 3 buildings, which will be selected randomly.  
    Therefore i created an prop family of the building.

    **Dependencies:**  
    As this is a relot of still existing BATs you have to download them  
    czestochowa1-0x5ad0e817\_0xf9db509d\_0x30000.SC4Model  
    czestochowa1-0x5ad0e817\_0xf9db509d\_0x30000.SC4Model  
    czestochowa3-0x5ad0e817\_0xb9db70af\_0x30000.SC4Model  
    ^^These are the model files created by szymcar. Without these files you will see no building on the Lots.  
    They are included in here: [3 small blocks](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=21922)  
      
    [BSC Textures vol. 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=90)  
    [BSC Mega Props CP vol. 01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)  
    [SFBT Essentials](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=750) (Version Dec. 2010)  
      
    **Installation:**  
    simply unzip the SC\_szymcar\_apartments folder into your Plugins folder. The readme\_and\_pics folder can be put where you want.  
    Due to the fact that i created new \*.SC4DESC files for these lots, there should be no conflicts with original szymcar lots.  
      
    **Credits go to:**  
    szymcar, for his beautiful BATs. As a special "Thank you" i decided to call the lots "szymcar apartments". You will see ingame.  
    Another Thank you to various members of the BSC Team for their Texture creations, and to all creators of props used on the lots!  
      
    special thanks to the simforum community for their advice and help.  
      
    Merry Christmas Simtropians!
