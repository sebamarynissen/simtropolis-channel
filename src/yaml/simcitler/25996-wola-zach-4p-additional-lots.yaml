#     **Installation:**

#     just unzip the "SCL\_kb7\_WolaZach4p\_relot" folder into your Plugins folder!

#     You can put the "WolaZach4p\_readme\_pics" folder where you want!

#     Due to the fact that i created new \*.SC4DESC files for these lots, there should be no conflicts with the original lots.
