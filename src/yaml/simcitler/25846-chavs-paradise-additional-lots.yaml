    Chavs Paradise (additional lots)

    This Lot pack contains nine (growable) residential lots for ill\_tonkso´s Chavs Paradise BAT. (Original can be found here: [Chavs Paradise](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=12489))  
    Due to a lack of R$$ lots for my own city projects i decided to give these nice BAT a new home.  
      
    Included are 9 different lots (4 R-$ Lots, 5 R-$$ Lots) which contain either 1, 2 or 3 buildings.  
    All of them will grow on medium and high density residential zones in Euro and Houston tilesets.

    **Installation:**  
    just unzip the "SC\_Chavs\_Paradise\_relot" folder into your Plugins folder!  
    You can put the "readme\_pics" folder where you want!  
    There should be no conflicts with the original lots, as i created new descriptor files!

    **ill\_tonkso**, for this great BAT.  
    various members of the **BSC Team** for their Texture creations, and to **all creators** of props used on the lots!
