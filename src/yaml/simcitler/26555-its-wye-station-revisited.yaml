    **ITS** **Wye station revisited**

    ([Original](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/files/file/19131-ndex-its-wye-station/) by ill tonkso)

    Wye station is a small countryside rail station (Lot size 6x3) which provides two platforms.

    In addition this relotted version features bus functionality, TE street connections, and eyecandy parking.

    Freight trains can pass the station, but the station is not acting as an freight station.

    In addition to the new lot design, I raised the capacity to 36.000 sims and "tuned" some other stats.

    **Stats:**

    Lot size: 6x3

    plop cost: 2000$

    monthly cost: 50$

    Transit Switch Entry Cost: 0,020

    capacity: 36.000

    power consumed: 4 kWh/month

    water consumed: 13 mÂ³/month

    air pollution: 4 over 1 tiles

    water pollution: 2 over 2 tiles

    garbage: 7 over 0 tiles
