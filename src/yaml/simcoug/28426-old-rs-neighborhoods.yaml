  summary: Old R$ Neighborhoods
  description: |-
    ***Description:***  
    This is a set of 50 growable R$ lots using a variety of small low wealth homes.  
    3 prop families were created from the various Maxis low wealth homes and are included with this set in order to maximize the variety of each lot.  
    In addition, I created a prop family using OnlyPlace4's Wild West shotgun houses.  
    The included lot sizes are: 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 1x3, 2x2, 2x3, 3x2, 3x3 and 3x4.  
    Each lot is modded with statistics equivalent to Maxis R$ values.  
    These 'neighborhoods' will **only grow on the Chicago tile set** (growth stages 1-3).

    **Installation:**  
    Simply unzip the file and put the entire 'SimCougs Old R$ Neighborhoods' folder in your plugins (don't forget the dependencies).  
      
    **Developer notes:**  
    I know, I know, you are all thinking "Holy stinkin' propbarf Batman!"  
    Yes, I realize the dependency list is extensive, but I like details on my lots, and these prop and texture packs have been hand-picked to offer the greatest bang for the buck.  
    As always, prop families were used extensively, so I guarantee you will not find the exact same lot twice (and if you do, you should buy a lotto ticket).  
    These lots were put together with my CJ [**New SorGun**](https://community.simtropolis.com/topic/48762-new-sorgun/) in mind, so they have more historical feel but they will not look out of place in your rural areas.  
    The smaller lot sizes have a fairly generic look and will blend together easily. Many of the larger lot sizes have some unique flair in order to add some character to your neighborhoods.  
    By mixing and matching the different lot sizes, you should be able to create completely unique low wealth neighborhoods.  
    I welcome any and all feedback, especially if it will make my future lot sets better. Thank you.

    **Special Thanks:**  
    Thanks to OP4 for creating the BLAM blank, which was used as the model for these lots.  
    Thanks to the great BATers who generously shared their prop models - this set would not be possible without them.  
    Also, thanks for the gang over at SimPeg for all the suggestions and encouragement.
