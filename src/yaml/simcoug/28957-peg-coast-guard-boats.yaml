  summary: PEG Coast Guard Boats
  description: |-
    **Description:**

    This is just a pair of lots that enable you to plop the PEG Coast Guard boats (Cutter and Patrol Boat) by themselves anywhere in the water.  

    Previously, these were part of an excellent PEG Coast Guard lot, but the boats were moored on the pier - now you can get these babies going out on the open ocean ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif ":)")

    **Dependencies:**

    **[PEG\-CDK3 Coast Guard Station](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19362-peg-cdk3-coast-guard-station/)**

    (specifically, the \**PEG\_CDK3\_CG-Equiptment\_RESOURCE.dat*)

    **Installation:**

    Simply unzip the file and put the entire 'SimCougs PEG CG Boats' folder in your plugins (don't forget the dependencies).  

    **Developer notes:** 

    You will find these boats under the 'Water Transportation' menu - simply plop them where ever you like.  No costs or benefits - these are simply eye-candy lots.    

    **Support:**

    Thanks to Pegasus for creating these awesome models, and thanks to Chris11 for the request.
