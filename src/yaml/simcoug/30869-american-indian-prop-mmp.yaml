  summary: American Indian Prop MMP
  description: |-
    **Description:**  
    This Mayor Mode Ploppable (MMP) allows you to plop various 'American Indian' props around your towns and cities.    
    The MMP allows 11 clicks to get the desired prop and orientation you wish.  
    The 12th click is a blank prop to cut down the need for bulldozing.

    **Dependencies:** (Only the .SC4Model files are needed)  
    \-[Sami props 1 by Glenni](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21217-sami-props/)  
    \-[Totem Pole by JohnB](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/3345-totem-pole/)  
    \-[BSC MEGA Props Jen\_P Vol01 by Jen\_P](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1259)

    **Installation:**  
    Simply unzip the file and put the entire  'Indian Props MMP' folder in your plugins (don't forget the dependencies).

    **Developer notes:**   
    This is another MMP I created a while back that was lost when SimPeg went down.  If you've ever needed to depict Native tribes or other types of historical scenes, now you can!   
    The icon will show up in your Mayor Mode flora menu.

    **Support:**  
    For questions regarding this MMP, please feel free to visit my Modding Development Thread ([SimCougs Lot&Mod Den](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68540-simcougs-lotmod-den/)) here on Simtropolis.

    **Special Thanks:**  
    A very special thanks to Glenni, JohnB and Jen\_P for creating and sharing these wonderful models.

    **EDIT:**  
    I have re-named the file in order to better describe it intended use.  My CJ focuses on the late 19th century, and includes a number of American Indian tribes, which is the common term in America.  That is how I used this MMP - you are free to use it however you wish.  I didn't intend to alert the PC police, so if I offended you, please accept my apology.  However, if my apology is not enough then by all means please downrate this file to make your voice heard.
