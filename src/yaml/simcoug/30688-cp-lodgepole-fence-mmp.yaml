  summary: CP Lodgepole Fence MMP
  description: |-
    **Description:**  
    This Mayor Mode Ploppable (MMP) allows you to plop CP's Lodgepole Fence props at various angles.    
    There are 4 different MMP files:  
    \-Ortho  
    \-Diagonal  
    \-22 Degrees Left  
    \-22 Degrees Right  
    Each MMP allows 9 clicks to get the desired orientation you wish (you can also nudge the fence prop slightly by adjusting your mouse after each click).  
    The 10th click is a blank prop to cut down the need for bulldozing.

    **Dependencies:**  
    **[BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)**

    **Installation:**  
    Simply unzip the file and put the entire 'CP Lodgepole Fence MMPs' folder in your plugins (don't forget the dependency).

    **Developer notes:**   
    This is another MMP I created a while back that was lost when SimPeg went down.  I enjoy painting fences into my landscapes and these provide an easy way to accomplish that.    
    It can be tricky at first, but with a little practice you can add fences to any landscape.  Keep in mind, there are two orientations of each prop, so continue to click until you achieve the desired result.    
      
    **Support:**  
    For questions regarding this MMP, please feel free to visit my Modding Development Thread (**[SimCougs Lot&Mod Den](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68540-simcougs-lotmod-den/)**) here on Simtropolis.

    **Special Thanks:**  
    A very special thanks to c.p. for creating and sharing all of his wonderful creations, including the props used in this MMP.
