    **SimCoug Cemetery Props MMP**

    **Description:**  
    Have you ever wanted to place tombstones without having to resort to a pre-created lot? Probably not, but if you do, then this MMP (found in the 'Mayor Mode' menu - look for the tombstone) is for you.  
    Now you can place tombstones, sarcophagi (yep, it's totally a word dude), or crypts with the click of the mouse, anywhere you want!  
    The MMP is organized into 9 different prop groups:  
    \-single tombstone  
    \-4 tombstones (square)  
    \-single row of tombstones  
    \-2 rows of tombstones  
    \-full tile of tombstones  
    \-single sarcophagus  
    \-2 rows of sarcophagi  
    \-single crypt  
    \-row of 3 crypts  
      
    Each group has two clicks, in order to better your chances of getting the correct orientation of the prop.  
    However, if that fails then the very last click is a blank in order to reduce the need to bulldoze.  
    See the example image on the STEX to get an idea of the different props you will get on each click.  
      
    **Installation:**  
    Simply put the folder in your plugins.  
      
    **Dependencies:**  
    None!  
      
    I'd like to thank the folks at SimPeg for their feedback and advice.

    Happy 'painting'.
