    **Description:**  
    I came across a discussion in the forums a little while back of somebody asking about a well lot to use as a water source.  Well (pun intended), I got to thinking, that might be really useful... I know I could certainly use something like that.  So here you are - two simple ground well lots that have the exact same properties as the Maxis water tower.  One of the lots includes a base texture and has more of a rural look.  The other is simply the well with no base texture or props... you can add MMPs to give it whatever look you desire.  Feel free to use one or the other (or both)...

    **Dependencies:**  
    None!  (I can't believe I just wrote that)

    **Installation:**  
    Simply unzip the file and put the entire 'SimCougs Little Well' folder in your plugins.  If you wish to use only one of the lots, simply delete the one you don't need.

    **Developer notes:**   
    This was really a one-off, simple lot... everything is Maxis based.  I created it in a couple hours (including testing).  If you run into any strangeness, please leave me a comment here.

    **Support:**  
    For questions regarding this set, please feel free to visit my Lot Development Thread (**[SimCoug's Lot Den](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68540-simcougs-lotmod-den/)**).

    **Special Thanks:**  
    Maxis, you darn sonuvagun... great looking props!
