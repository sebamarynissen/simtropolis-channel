    **Description:**

    This is a set of 9 stairway lots that allows sims to traverse slopped terrain safely (no more sliding down steep hills on your butt).

    There are two lot versions - one that requires no dependencies (Stairway\_NoDependency\_Lots) and one that only requires BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01 (Stairway\_CP\_Lots).  

    If you want to play with only the no dependency lots, simply delete the Stairway\_CP\_Lots.dat file and you are good to go. 

    You will find all the lots grouped together in the park menu (probably towards the bottom of the menu, depending on your plugins).  Each lot if $5 to plop, but no maintenance costs.

    These lots can be safely placed at almost any slope, but as you go beyond a 15m slope, the stairs will begins to look pretty steep as well.

    Every lot is transit enabled for pedestrians, so sims can travel through the lot without a problem.

    Go ahead, build your very own Sim-Stairway to Heaven. 

    **Dependencies:**

    None - unless you want to use the Stairway\_CP\_Lots, in which case you will need:

    **[BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1180)**

    **Installation:**

    Simply unzip the file and put the entire 'SimCougs Stairways' folder in your plugins (don't forget the dependency if you intend to use the CP lots).  

    **Developer notes:** 

    These lots should blend in with most towns or cities - there is a number of different lot configurations, including a simple stairway without any base texture.

    The base textures are compliant with sidewalk overrides.

    **Support:**

    **Special Thanks:**

    A huge thanks goes out to **Reddonquixote** for modeling the stairs and putting up with countless failed renders (apparently the BAT doesn't like stair props).

    **mgb** (aka rsc204) was also deserves a big shout out for helping me with the transit modding.

    Finally, I'd like to thank uroncha for giving me the initial idea for these lots with his '**[Adjustable Stairway](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/13908-adjustable-stairway/)**' lot that can be found on the STEX.  

    Enjoy!
