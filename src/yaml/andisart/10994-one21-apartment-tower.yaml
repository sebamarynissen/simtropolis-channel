    **Contains a growable and a functional ploppable version.**

    Lot Size: 3x2

    **R§§ Residents : 380**

    Tileset(s): Houston, European

    Bulldoze Cost: 450

    Construction Time: 40

    It has a slight landmark effect (effect: 4, range: 10). No mayor rating improvement.

    PLEASE NOTE: In order to keep the ploppable functional you need to zone residential area and allow buildings to build there first and make sure they are sending out commuters. Once that happens you can plop over them and have it work ok. (Thanks to Thalassicus for this tip)

    Plop Cost: § 32.000

    **A german version has been released on simszone.de soon.**

    This is my second BAT and my first release, I am proud to present it : )
