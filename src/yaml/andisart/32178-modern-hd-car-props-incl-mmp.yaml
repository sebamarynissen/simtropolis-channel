    AndisArt presents:

    **Modern HD Car Props (incl. MMP)**

    \----------------------------------------------------------------

    This prop pack adds modern cars to your game as props (not as functioning automata/driving cars).  
    There are 10 different vehicles with different colorings, totalling 30 variants. All models were rendered in HD, also know as Zoom 6.

    Vehicle models:

    ⦁    Audi Concept Car  
    ⦁    Audi Roadster  
    ⦁    Audi TT  
    ⦁    VW Beetle  
    ⦁    Futuristic Bike  
    ⦁    Citroen C4  
    ⦁    Mazda MX5  
    ⦁    Nissan 350Z  
    ⦁    Smart  
    ⦁    VW Touareg

    The props can be used individually or as a prop family. Item names start with "AndisArt\_PROP\_carpack", followed by the model name and color. Prop family ID is 0A341980.

    There is a test lot that can be found in the landmark menu for an overview of all models.

    Can also be used in Mayor mode under tree menu as MMP (Mayor-Mode-Ploppable). If you do not wish to have this function you can delete the file AndisArt\_PROP\_carpack\_MMP.dat  in the download folder. Special thanks to [@Girafe](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/319793-girafe/) for the MMP modding

    \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **Installation**:

    Extract the whole folder and copy it to your SimCity 4 Plugins folder (usually MyDocuments/SimCity 4/Plugins).

    You can now use the models in the Lot Editor or with any download that has this file as a dependency.

    The test lot is an individual file and can be deleted if not required.
