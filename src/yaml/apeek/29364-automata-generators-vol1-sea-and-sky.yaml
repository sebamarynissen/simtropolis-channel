    **FANTA1990** Presents:

    Breath life into your skies and water ways with a series of lots built specifically to spawn a variety of marine vessels and one to give your resident dare devils an outlet for their dangerous appetites.

    *1x1\_AirShowParkV2.dat* - The crown gem of this package will thrill your sims with regular and sometimes disastrous air shows.

    *Recreational Boat Gen.dat* - Plop directly on water to swiftly generate wake with yachts and speed boats to stir up your seas.

    *Cruise & Cargo Ship Gen.dat* - Creates two menu icons, one for thumping cargo ships and another that will cause cruise ships to materialize.

    *Fishing Boat Gen + Cargo.dat* - Cleverly spawns commercial fishing vessels complete with smoke and seagulls using inconspicuous bouys to prevent surface distortions. The technique is tied to cargo ships, so they too will occasionally crop up amongst the others.

    *Steam Boat Gen.dat* - Will add a classical feel to your marine setting with the appearance of steam ships trailed by dirty plumes of smoke and steam.

    All of the above generators appear in the parks menu. The Maxis Air Force Base must exist in the plugins folder for proper operation of the Air Show Park and Steam Ship Generator. You can download it from the link below (as found on the [Maxis Files](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/) page).

    \*\*\* This automata generator mod was originally posted along with many other spectacular creations by Fanta Soda on his SimCity China homepage with the following URL:  
    [http://www.SimCity.cn/thread-99303-1-1.html](http://www.simcity.cn/thread-99303-1-1.html)

    Fanta has taken great lengths to make his site accessible to English speaking users. However, I encourage you to exploit the automatic translation features available in browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, or one of many Add-ons for Internet Explorer. Mandatory registration will unlock Fanta's downloads and all other custom content on SimCity China. A login prompt and two verification screens may seem excessive, but are well worth it.

    Since Fanta spends considerable time manufacturing custom mods, he specifically requested my assistance publishing his work to the mainstream English speaking audience. All credit and responsibility for this download lies solely with Fanta Soda. He will personally read and perhaps respond to any praise, feedback, criticism, or suggestions to this post. More impressive works from Fanta will follow.

    **\-CB Edit:** Updated dependency link.
