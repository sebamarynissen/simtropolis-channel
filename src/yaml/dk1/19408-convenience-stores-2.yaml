  summary: Convenience Stores 2
  description: |-
    5 different buildings belonging to a prop family, so the stores will be random. This set includes: Couche- Tard, Kum & Go, Lawson, QuickChek and Valero. Cs$1x2 and Cs$2x2 (pumps), jobs: 15, growth stage: 1, zone density: low, medium, high. LM1x2 and LM2x2 (pumps), jobs: 15 Cs$, build: 100. IMPORTANT: All files named convenience store or convenience pump were included with my first set of stores. If you already have them you do not need these. Last year, to promote The Simpsons Movie, select 7-Eleven stores were converted to Kwik-E-Marts. I have included a LM1x2 version with 15 Cs$ jobs.
