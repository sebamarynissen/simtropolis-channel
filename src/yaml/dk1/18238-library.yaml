  summary: Library
  description: |-
    4x4 Library, coverage 1000m, books 20000, build 500, bulldoze 100, budget 150, EQ boost 10, approx. 90-100 jobs. I have also included a 1x4 parking lot, can be seen in night picture on left and right of library. The parking lot can be placed anywhere. Found in the park menu it has some park and landmark effect, build 50, bulldoze 10, budget 5. If you do not want the extra parking, just don't extract the files named parking lot.
