  summary: Cycleways Basic Pack
  description: |-
    These lots are an upgrade of the original Cycleway lots, and they have been modded properly this time.

    These cycleway lots are found in the health menu for two reasons: the health menu is relatively uncrowded, and these cycleways give a +4 health benefit over 20 tiles. They can be found at the very top.

    There are 7 lots in this basic package, and all new textures.

    These lots include:

    -   1x1 Straight Cycleway
    -   Tee Intersection
    -   X Intersection
    -   Diagonal
    -   Diagonal Corner Left
    -   Diagonal Corner Right
    -   Street Transition

    More pieces will be added in future expansion packs.

    This utilises a similar plopping system to jeronij's diagonal park trails with one important difference: you cannot seamlessly switch from diagonal to straight without using a diagonal corner piece.

    This lot uses a custom query and custom menu icon.

    There are no dependencies, though the NAM may be required for some pedestrian enabling to work as intended. It is recommended that you remove the original cycleways \[Version 1\] from your plugins folder and replace these with the new cycleways, but it is not necessary. All bug reports can be posted here. I have tried my best to weed out as many bugs as possible.

    This is a NO-DEPENDENCY lot, using only Maxis props, and the textures inside this zip file. If so requested, the textures may be released in a seperate zip file for LOT-BUILDERs.

    A close-up image can be found here.

    UPDATED 27 MARCH 2006 - REMOVED TEXTURE BUG: TEXTURE FILE IS NOW AVAILABLE AS A SEPERATE DOWNLOAD.
