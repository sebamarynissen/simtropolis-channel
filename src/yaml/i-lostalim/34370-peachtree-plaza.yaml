  summary: Peachtree Plaza
  description: |-
    Peachtree Plaza is based on real cylindrical towers throughout the US. This one is modeled from the building of the same name from SimCity 3000. Careful attention was given to the windows/glass, so the appearance would look similar to other glass towers within SC4. Highlighting, gradients, and reflections were all accounted for.

    **No Dependencies!**

    Both CO$$$ and landmark versions available. Detailed stats in screenshots.
