  summary: Prop Hedge Collection 3
  description: |-
    Prop Hedge Collection 3 is the third volume in the series. It has taken over 17324 shapes to model every inch of the hedge correctly (down to modeling the leaves themselves). There was so much detail that the computer started to freeze and skip, sometimes crashing the program.

    These hedges come in three new varieties:

    Evergreen

    Light green

    Autumn Yellow

    To install, just put the files from the corresponding folder you want and put it in your plugins folder.

    No Dependencies!
