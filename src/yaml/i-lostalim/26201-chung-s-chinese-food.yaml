    Chung's Chinese Food

    Chung's Chinese Food is a luxury, high wealth commercial service that serves gourmet chinese food. The surrounding structure has cafe tables, green canopies, planters, gold and stone trim, and foliage. Inside the building are marble floors, atmospheric lighting, rare Asian plants that surround the tables and booths. At night in front of the building the logo lights up at night to show walking pedestrians that Chung's Chinese Food is open for business. The sign also lights up to show commuters from a distance. The next time you plan a corporate meeting, birthday, wedding, or you just want to enjoy a gourmet Chinese meal, come on down to Chung's Chinese Food! Open from 10am-12pm Monday-Sunday.

    We also provide catering for parties and business events.
