    #### **SC4 Legacy - KS\_JPN Arabian Canal**

    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the complete set of the Arabain Canal by KS\_JPN, including Props and Lots, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.

    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and provide technical support for the pack.

    ### INSTALLATION:

    This package is a simple .zip file. Just extract the ks\_jpn folder to your My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins directory (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location).

    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.
    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and by using either the newer [nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) or the older [BSC Cleanitol](index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol) tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
