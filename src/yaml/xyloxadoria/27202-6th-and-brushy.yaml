  summary: 6th and Brushy
  description: |-
    After a long break from the STEX, im finally back with another building. This was a class project for my portfolio, but I decided to render it out for Sc4 because I figure someone would want it. The Render is in HD.

    It is a accurate recreation of the 6th and Brushy Condominiums. The condos get their name from the intersection where they are located in Austin Texas.
