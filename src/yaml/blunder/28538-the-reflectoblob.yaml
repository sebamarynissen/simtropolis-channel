    **The Reflectoblob**

    ~a blundered BAT

    Inspired by (and poorly mimicking) [Cloud Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) in Chicago, the reflectoblob is a Landmark style piece of urban art for your downtown.

    Comes in Dark Night and Maxis Night varieties: please download only one. \*Note for relotters- the two separate models do not share the same TGI's, so relotting for one -night model will not automatically work for both.

    Each model comes with 2 lots:

    **Reflectoblob Plaza** - This is a simple lot with only the basic landmark effect.

    **Reflectoblob Monument** \- Same as the Plaza but also has the cap relief effects of the Convention and Research centers combined in one. I did that because i wanted to get those effects without plopping those lots for myself in my downtowns. As such it needs road access, but thankfully pedmalls fulfill this requirement.

    Both lots appear near the top of your Landmarks menu.

    The base texture is just the simple medium wealth white, and consequently should get overwritten if you use a texture changer, like in my 3rd pic.

    This file has No dependencies, however it is an HD export, so hardware rendering may be necessary (which you should already be using if you use an HD terrain mod).

    For questions, comments, suggestions, whatever, please visit my BAT thread at simpeg.com: [Blundered BATs](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/forum/index.php?topic=9864.0).

    Happy Gaming ![:D](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaGrin.gif)
