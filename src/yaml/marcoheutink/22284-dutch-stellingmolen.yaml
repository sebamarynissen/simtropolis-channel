    The Stellingmolen (a Dutch windmill) towers high above the cities. These machines were the power houses before electricity made its arrival.

    This upload includes an animated and still version.

    Pick whichever one you like!

    Update: edited both lots

    2x2 Utility: Power

    Budget 150

    Bulldoze cost 150

    Plop cost 1500

    Power 1000

    (and the same beneficial effects as a normal windmill)

    \---------------------------------------

    Read carefully

    \- The stellingmolen is the biggest type of windmill, it can be 6 stories high

    \- The first two floors are a house, above that is two floors of storage room and above that are two floors with  mechanics

    \- There is a big family (13 kids, 2 parents, 4 grandparents and 1 opoe) living in the mill. That's why there is a garden in the back.
