    **mGeneral info**

    This is my second and much expanded take on the P44 series of mass housing proliferated in Moscow in last 10 years.

    Download includes:

    **8 models:**

    -   2  25 storey orthogonal towers (1 with white  and 1 with brick detailing)
        
    -   2  25 storey diagonal towers (1 with white  and 1 with brick detailing)
        
    -   2  16 storey orthogonal towers (1 with white  and 1 with brick detailing) 
        
    -   2  16 storey diagonal towers (1 with white  and 1 with brick detailing) 
        

    and 6 lots:

    -   1 design for orthogonal towers (common for 25 and 16 storey towers
        
    -   1 design for orthogonal towers (common for 25 and 16 storey towers
        

    "white" or "brick" design will be picked to grow at random by the game. Additional information, stats and lot designs are provided in the readMe file.

    This version differs from one available at LEX in that it doesn’t require CAM to grow.

    **mInstallation instruction**

    Release comes in the form of installer. Unzip and double click.Models and Lots will be placed into:

    /My Docs\*/SimCity 4/Plugins/SimFox/R$$/Non\_Cam/p44t

    readMe with JPGs into:

    /My Docs\*/SimCity 4/SimFox\_readme

    \* my Docs = My Documents (Windows XP/2000) / Documents (Windows Vista)

    Make sure you read through the Read me as it contains important information, as well as live links to the dependencies.

    **mDependencies**

    I have departed with my usual No Dependencies policy in this release and it has quite a few. In my defense I have to say that most of my new releases will be using same library and I'm sure many of you already have them. Here is a list.

    Props:

    BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01.dat essential

    SimFoxProps\_8Chestnuts.dat essential

    BSC MEGA Props CP Vol01(optional, but recommended)

    BSC MEGA Props - DAE Vol01.dat (optional, but recommended)

    BSC MEGA Props - MJB Vol01.dat (optional, but recommended)

    BSC Mega Props jestarr Vol02.dat (optional, but recommended)

    CSX MEGA Props - Vol03.dat (optional, but recommended)

    Overlay textures (essential):

    BSC Textures Vol 01.dat

    BSC Textures Vol 02.dat

    Live links are (as I have already mentioned) in ReadMe that will be displayed at the end of installation process.

    PS.

    lots seem to be very easy to grow

    have Fun!
