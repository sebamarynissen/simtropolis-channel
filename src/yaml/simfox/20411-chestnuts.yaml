  description: |-
    A Prop set of chestnut trees (altogether 8 models) that will be used in my upcoming releases.

    All models are grouped into a family and as such may provide variety for the LOTs.

    These are day only ( no special night lighting) so they with some tweaking may be used for mass plantations.

    Enjoy
