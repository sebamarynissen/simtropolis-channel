    **NYBT ABBT Manhattanville Project (1stPack)**  
      
    Manhattanville Project is the effort of the ABBT, group of BATters, in recreating Manhattan's neighborhood of Manhattanville.  
      
    The industrial part of this historic neighborhood is being redeveloped for the needs of Columbia University, and with this project we are trying to preserve as much of it as we can. Our effort can also be viewed as a contribution to the game's much needed segment - industrial wall-to-wall buildings.
