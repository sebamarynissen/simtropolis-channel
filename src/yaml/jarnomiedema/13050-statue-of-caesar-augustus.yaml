    At the age of 23 Gaius Octavius joined the army of his great-uncle Julius Caesar and

    distinguished himself at the Battle of Munda. Impressed with his grand-nephew's conduct,

    Caesar adopted Octavius as his son and appointed him to be his heir. Octavius adopted

    the new name of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus..

    emerged victoriously as Caesar Augustus, Augustus meaning 'the exalted one'. Augustus

    completed Caesar's dream of unifying Rome under one man and became the very first Emperor

    of Rome..

    Roman Emperors. He established Rome's first permanent Army and Navy, repaired, finished or

    rebuilt Rome's most famous structures. Most famously, Augustus' rule is charactarized by the

    so-called 'Pax Romana', or 'Roman Peace', which lasted for more than two centuries after his

    death.

    'Caesar' continued as royal titles up to the twentieth century. Think of the German 'Kaiser' and

    Russian 'Tsar'..
