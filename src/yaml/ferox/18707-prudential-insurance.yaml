  summary: Prudential Insurance, Warsaw
  description: |-
    English insurance company Prudential started the construction of this building in 1931, at the intersection of Swietokrzyska street and Napoleon Square (currently Warsaw Insurgents Square). In that time there were already a few high-rise buildings in the city, but none of them was as big as new, 66-metre-high skyscraper. Main designer of Prudential was engineer Marcin Weinfeld, who was already well-known it Warsaw at that time, as was the author of many successful projects of houses. The building's structure was designed by famous constructor professor Stefan Bryla, who had designed before, among other things, many projects of bridges. Among them, the most famous one was the first in the world welded steel road bridge over small river Sludwia, in village Maurzyce, near Lowicz, west of Warsaw. 1500 tonnes of steel, 2 million bricks and 2 thousand tonnes of cement was used to construct the building. Soon, the skyscraper arouse a lot of controversy. People from surrounding houses started to complain that it was too big, it was blocking out the sunlight. They even demanded its knockdown. But that was not proceeded and the building stood until Second World War. In 1938 an experimental TV mast was installed on its top.

    In 1944, during Warsaw Uprising, Prudential was seriously damaged. In some days, a bullet was hitting the building averagely once for 8 minutes. But thanks to its solid structure, the building remained standing. However, its damages were significant.

    Few years after the war, the building was restored. But it was modified much. The pre-war elevation, that had been quite easy and rather 'cheerful' was changed into more dull, monumental one, representing social realistic style, which was popular at that time. Also the building's name and destiny were changed. Prudential became Warszawa Hotel. 53 one-person rooms, 73 2-person rooms and three apartments were located here.

    On 1st of July 2003 the hotel stopped functioning, because its standard already became too low for Warsaw hotel market. Currently, the building is under modernization.
