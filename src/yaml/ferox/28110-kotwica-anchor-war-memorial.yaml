  summary: Kotwica (Anchor) War Memorial, Warsaw
  description: |-
    The Kotwica (\[kɔtˈfit​͡sa\]; Polish for "Anchor") was a World War II emblem of the Polish Secret State and Armia Krajowa (Home Army, or AK). It was created in 1942 by members of the AK Wawer "Small Sabotage" unit as an easily usable emblem for the Polish struggle to regain independence. The initial meaning of the initials "PW" was "Pomścimy Wawer" ("We will avenge Wawer"). The Wawer massacre was considered to be one of the first large scale massacres of Polish civilians by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. At first, Polish scouts from sabotage groups painted the whole phrase upon walls. However, this was soon shortened to two letters, P and W, due to time constraints.

    The P and W initials evolved into the Kotwica (Anchor) - a combination of the letters which was easy and fast to paint. The Kotwica began to signify more than just its intended abbreviation, taking on more meanings such as Polska Walcząca ("Fighting Poland"), Wojsko Polskie ("Polish Army") and Powstanie Warszawskie ("Warsaw Uprising"). Eventually, the Kotwica became a patriotic symbol of defiance against occupiers and was painted in a graffiti style on building walls.

    This monument was build in Mound of the Warsaw Uprising.

    This mound was formed by the debris of the old city of Warsaw, which was completely demolished in 1944 by the Germans. Today a *Kotwica* - symbol of the Polish underground army - stands on top of the hill, commemorating the citizens of Warsaw and the Polish soldiers perished between 1939 and 1944. Visitors may enjoy the impressive Warsaw panorama from here.
