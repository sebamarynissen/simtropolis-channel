  description: |-
    Using my erlier BAT i create 4 diagonal buildings, they are landmarks - plop cost -110$ monthly cost -0$

    I don't make functional landmarks witch jobs, because they must by plopped next to street. Landmarks could be plopped next to square or pavement. But if You want those building witch jobs just say and i try to make it ![:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaSmile.gif)
