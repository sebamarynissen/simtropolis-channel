    Hello, here is a file, "**Delecto Essentials Files**", that is required for proper functionality of my future creations.

    \================================================

    V1.0 / January 2014

    \================================================

    Currently this file contains the following props:

    ![pqei.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img198/1570/pqei.jpg)

    "**Delecto FootPath Set1**" which are located in the Lot Editor under the following names:

    Del\_Path\_3m\_00
    Del\_Path\_8m\_00
    Del\_Path\_16m\_00
    Del\_Path\_3m\_45
    Del\_Path\_8m\_45
    Del\_Path\_12m\_45
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_A\_00
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_B\_00
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_C\_00
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_A\_45
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_B\_45
    Del\_Path\_Curve\_C\_45

    These Props will receive shadows from buldings and other props (such as trees) and can be joined to form very flexible footpaths.

    Simply lift them by .1m in the Lot Editor to avoid graphical errors that can occur with flat props and enjoy.

    \===============================================

    I'll update this file frequently. so keep an eye on it. ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
