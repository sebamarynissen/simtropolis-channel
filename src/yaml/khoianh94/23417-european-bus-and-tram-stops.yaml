  summary: European Bus and Tram Stops
  description: |-
    **New: Additional lots with HD bus stops for FARR and some updates are available [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=23722).**  
      
    This Download contains 15 lots with several bus and tram stops for your city:

    -   Five lots with normal bus stops just like the ones from Maxis, but with higher capacities. They base on two models: The first (made by khoianh) is available in three different colours while the second (made by Fluggi) comes as normal and diagonal version.
    -   Four lots with bus stops which can be placed on roads. Three of them base on narrower versions of khoianh's normal bus stop models, the forth lot has a simple bench for areas with low congestion.
    -   Six lots for the tramway (GLR) with the three narrow bus models and two lot sizes (2x1, 3x1) with different capacities.

    khoianh's Models and props are HD rendered to show the maximum amount of details.

    **Dependencies:**

    -   Network Addon Mod (for tram stations)
