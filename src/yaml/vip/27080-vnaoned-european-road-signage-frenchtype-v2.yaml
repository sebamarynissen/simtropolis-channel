  summary: Vnaoned European Road Signage
  description: |-
    MMP Roads Signage . These signboards are inspired by the European standard most of the time , but rather by the French one concerning the directional signboards .
    Like all MMPs , you will find them in the Mayor menu .

    From Citymax MMP's picture (MMP nÂ°5 ) , the 4 last models have been removed . Except that point , all models are presented on these pictures in the order corresponding to their respective MMP range .

    Furthermore , they have a feature ; the latter MMP examplar is an invisible model , so with a light gap with your mouse , you can start again sequences untill you get the desired model with the proper orientation .

    Good luck ! (With this pack you will , possibly , hate the VIP team.)

    -   Menu Position : Mayor Mod
    -   Plop Cost : 0$
    -   Bulldoze Cost : 0$
    -   Montly Cost 0$

    \*\*the former *VIP\_VV\_RoadsProps.dat* has been removed from this upload, as the linked dependency pack contains the necessary models with lotting props too.

    **INSTALLATION**

    **Installation**: Copy/extract the **VIP** parent folder into your plugins. If you extracted the *~Documents* folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of the Plugins folder.
