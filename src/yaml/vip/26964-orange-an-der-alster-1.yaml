    **Auto Installation:** Double-click the installer file to start the installation. The program will guide you through the process. You can change the default installation path, but we strongly suggest to keep the standard folder in order to make future updates and additions easier.
    **MAC Users:** [File Juicer](http://echoone.com/fr/filejuicer/) should enable you to use this installer package. If it's ZIP archive it is necessary to make the same manipulation that during installation manual (see above).
