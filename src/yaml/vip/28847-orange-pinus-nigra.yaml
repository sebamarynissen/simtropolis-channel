  description: |-
    **Pinus nigra** is a large coniferous evergreen tree, growing to 20–55 metres (66–180 feet) high at maturity and spreading to 6 to 12 m (20 to 39 ft) wide. The bark is gray to yellow-brown, and is widely split by flaking fissures into scaly plates, becoming increasingly fissured with age. The leaves ('needles') are thinner and more flexible in western populations.
