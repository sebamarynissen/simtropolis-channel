  summary: Stop Maxis Mansions from growing
  description: |-
    This is a mod that stops low density Maxis R$$$ (the huge, sprawling mansions) from growing in your game. But the higher density R$$$ condos and apartments still grow, as well as 2 of the smaller 2X2 high wealth homes that blend in better.

    **INSTALLATION:**

    Simply unzip and place the DAT  file in your documents/SimCity 4/plugins folder.

    No dependencies.

    **CREDIT GOES TO ANDREAS ROTH FOR THIS TUTORIAL:**

    If you are comfortable with using Ilive's reader to mod, you can make a similar effect to any degree you want if you are unhappy with any of the things this mod allows you to grow.  Simply take any existing block-all-R$$$ mod, highlight any of the exemplars which represent the buildings you still want to grow, delete those exemplars and save as a new DAT.
