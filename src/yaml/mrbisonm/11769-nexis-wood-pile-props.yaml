  summary: Nexis Wood Pile Props
  description: |-
    For those who want to build their own sawmills,construction sites and/or Lumberyards, here are 4 Props ( not lots) for your pleasure to build with the LE. You can pile them on top of each other or use them simply like they are. It's up to you.
    There will be a BAT soon that I will upload and which uses these BATprops. The props then will be included again with the .lotfile , so you just delete the props and only keep the lot file,when it comes out ,if you already have downloaded these props here.

    4 .desc and 4 .model files, picture and readme text included
    Have Fun with Nexis.
    mrb

    Read Nexis .txt for further information on using these props publically.
