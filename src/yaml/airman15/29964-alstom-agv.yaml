    About the upload-

    This upload replaces the Passenger Train with an Alstom AGV. There are two files included. One replaces the engine and the other replaces the coaches. The train includes custom nightlights.

    Dependencies?

    There are none required. Though it is recommended to use a catenary mod (such as the [Rail Catenary Mod V3](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21935-rail-catenary-mod-v3-hd-version/)) for cosmetics (since they would complement the theme of electric trains).
