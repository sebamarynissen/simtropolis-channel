  summary: 707 Livery Pack
  description: |-
    Do you like the Boeing 707 but hate the default in-game textures? If so, then this little mod is for you! Inside this package are 3 different files, each containing a .DAT file that you can just plop into your plugins folder and they will appear when you start the game. There are two real world airlines:

    Pan Am (defunct)

    American Airlines (Present Livery)

    Plus, I threw in a bonus VU Airlines (the money has to come from somewhere, and I doubt his other deals are enough for him to afford paying you when you do him favors..)

    \*\*\*Installation\*\*\*

    Its very easy to install.. even a monkey can do it! Just copy the .DAT file of your choice and plop it into your plugins folder. The .DAT overrides the default texture and voila! You now have a real or fictional-based-on-real 707 flying around your cities and regions! Photos are included and I also included pictures of the real airliners for 2 of the 3 to show which scheme I tried to follow.

    There is one catch, though and that is you can only run one mod at a time.. I tried to do so and the next mod cancels out the previous one.

    \*\*\*Copyright\*\*\*

    The only copyrights here are the use of real company names/logos, specifically American Airlines and Pan Am. Also copyright goes to Maxis for the original 707 model.
