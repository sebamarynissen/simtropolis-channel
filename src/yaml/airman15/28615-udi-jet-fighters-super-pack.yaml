  summary: UDI Jet Fighters Super Pack
  description: |-
    Last year, I uploaded a super pack of UDI jet fighters. While people were having fun flying around town, I knew I wasn't finished with these planes. So I present to you a second volume of jets- aptly named the UDI Superpack V2. There are some familiar ones returning and some that were added or replaced  entirely. In this pack, you will have an Air Force for flying around or exacting revenge on EA. The list of aircraft included are as follows-
      

    F-14 Tomcat
    F-15 Eagle
    F-16 Fighting Falcon
    F/A-18 Hornet
    F-35 Lightning II
    YF-22 Raptor
      

    Chengdu J-20
    Mig-21 Fishbed
    Mig-25 Foxbat
    Mig-29 Fulcrum
    SUkhoi PAK/FA
    Su-47 Berkut
      
    About the upload:
    This is an updated collection of UDI jet fighters, which spawn at Area 5.1. The files with 'V2' on them are updated versions of the previous aircraft. The ones with V2 use the same .dat file as the old jets, but have simpler, more detailed models and enhanced texturing.
      
    Dependencies?
    None needed.
      
    Installation:
    Just take a .DAT file from the pack and place it in your plugins folder.
    Please note you can only choose one jet from the pack.
