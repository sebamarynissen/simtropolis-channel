  summary: Ford Anglias
  description: |-
    In a developed society, people need cars. But not everyone can afford the beefed-up supercar or a pimped out import with the gull-wing doors and wheels the size of dinner tables. That's why we have economy cars. They're reliable, efficient and don't take up much parking space. It's a brilliant concept, but would you want to settle for only one model? Well, you don't have to- Introducing the Ford Anglia.
      
    About the upload:
      

    This file adds the Ford Anglia as not only an AI vehicle, but as a drivable My Sim car for those with Deluxe or Rush Hour. It is a Low Wealth vehicle, and can be driven by your Sim no matter the wealth status. These cars are new instances, meaning they do not replace any existing vehicle. The file should work with Software settings.
