  summary: "Cruise Ship Port Mod"
  description: |-
    When I unlocked the original Cruise Ship Port, I was very

    disappointed about what I saw. I took one look and I said

    to myself "I went through all that trouble to unlock this

    thing and THIS is what I get?!" I hated the way it looked

    when I first saw it. The "dock" looked like it would break

    apart, the parking lot was screwed up and overall it

    looked ugly. So I fixed it. The new changes are:

    1\. The parking lots look new and have a path for cars to

    get in and out easier.

    2\. The Dock looks newer.

    3\. Seagulls now fly overhead.

    4\. The loop in front of the Terminal is now shorter.

    5\. The lot has more decoration to it.

    and 6.  The whole lot now looks richer

    This Mod replaces the original Cruise Ship Port in SimCity.

    Enjoy!
