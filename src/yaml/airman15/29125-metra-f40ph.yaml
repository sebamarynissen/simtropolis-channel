  summary: Metra F40PH
  description: |-
    Need a quick way to get from city to city without having to deal with hostile roadways or crowded airports? Taking the train is always the nice and easy way, and when you travel by rail you want to stand out! In painted in a blue that would make Thomas the Tank Engine jealous and built to take the heavy task of pulling loaded cars, the F40PH is here once again to take to the countryside! At the end of the day, you'll wish you could take the train everywhere!

    About the upload:

    The .DAT file will change whatever locomotive you have into an F40PH sporting Metra colors. This is ideal for those working on a Chicago-style region. You can still drive it, this is only a model/skin change reverse-engineered from i-photon's P42-DC. The textures can be used for Software settings.
