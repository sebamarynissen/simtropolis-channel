  summary: Beavis and Butt-head Loading Text Mod
  description: |-
    Ah, Utopia. A place where everything is perfect and everyone is happy. You'd expect that in a place like this, the population would elect a responsible figure to lend a guiding hand, right? WRONG! Apparently your city was dumb enough to elect just about anyone and it just had to pick two of the dumbest, most unqualified morons of them all. Since when did people think electing Beavis and Butt-head would be a good idea? And how can a city possibly function when these high school rejects have only chicks, nachos, and heavy metal on their minds? Get ready to find out and hope to God they don't touch that FIRE TOOL!

    About the upload-

    This is a replacement for the text that appears as you are loading a city tile. Several lines reference episodes from the show and several were written similar to how the moronic duo would act if they were elected to city hall.

    Dependencies?

    None.

    This mod was based on Craig-Abcvs' Text Loading Mod. This file is not for everyone, as it contains crude humor and mild language, possibly making this file the most immature on the Simtropolis Exchange.

    Beavis and Butt-head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do would cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put it another way- Don't try this at home.
