  summary: Air France Regional Set
  description: |-
    Flying is an excellent means of travelling that offers some spectacular views. but not everyone can learn to fly, let alone those styrofoam RC toys that come from a hobby shop. There are planes that are capable of takimg you where you need to go, but who's willing to fly them? Air France is a top-of-the-line carrier that will take you anywhere! Whether it's to the next town or across the countryside, you'll be flying with one of the best names out there!
    
    About the upload-
    This is a set of aircraft which replace several Maxis aircraft. They appear at the airport and will be seen flying around your city. There are three aircraft included:
    - An **Embraer ERJ-135**, which replaces the business jet.
    - A **Lockheed Constellation**, which replaces the Douglas DC-7
    - And lastly, an **RJ-85**, which replaces the BAe-146. This aircraft is a remodel of the original, but keeps some of the original texturing intact.

    Some of the texturing used was taken from online sources. The textures fro the ERJ-135 were found on Google Images, the RJ-85 textures are from Maxis and the Constellation textures were originally for Flight Simulator 2004 and were created by Julien Scavini and hosted on [Flyaway Simulation](http://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/16565/fs2004-air-france-super-constellation-f-bhba/).
