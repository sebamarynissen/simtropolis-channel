  summary: Kamov KA-50
  description: |-
    Need a helicopter that will take out anything that moves and horrify your targets doing so? Russia has an answer to that- the Kamov KA-50! Also known as the Black Shark, this beast will stop a convoy cold and make the generals in neighbouring countries lose sleep at night. So get out there and show the enemy who's the boss around here!

    About the file-

    This file is meant to add the KA-50 as a replacement for the Attack Helicopter. It will spawn at the Army Base or other lot which spawns the Attack Helicopter.

    Dependencies?

    None required.

    This model was made using an unfinished model which I downloaded from [TF3DM](http://tf3dm.com/) (courtesy of Makrushin Andrey) then textured and converted for use as automata.

    This file was requested by sarthakknight and has been made available for all to download on the Exchange!
