    Ah, the experience of Airline Travel.. Long lines, rude faculty, shady people you shouldn't trust, uncomfortable planes that have layers of duct tape holding vital pieces together.. you get the idea. Business is slow because the current aircraft flying around are as fast as a horse- with 3 broken legs. Well now there is a plane that can cut travel time at least in half- this plane is fast enough to shatter the sound barrier! This baby can soar in altitudes of at least 40,000 ft and still be a comfortable flight. This is the CONCORDE!
      

    This sleek liner can cross an ocean in a matter of hours and delays are not a problem, unless of course the whole airport is closed. It may not be the most fuel efficient, but any sim will tell you is is by far one of the most beautiful jets in the sky. In fact a survey showing that nine out of ten people say the Concorde is the superior airliner was enough for two new airlines to steal the competition from another airline that once dominated the skies. The results don't lie- with the Concorde, air travel is now much more efficient.
      

    And remember- Don't fly Old Timer aircraft.. Fly Concorde!
      
      

    About the upload-
      

    The DAT files go into your plugins folder. Once done, start the game and the Concordes should appear. The Liveries used are based on the real world markings for their respective nationalities. In the game, they can be seen parked at the Municipal Airport or International Airport. In order for this upload to work properly, make sure you have Hardware settings.
