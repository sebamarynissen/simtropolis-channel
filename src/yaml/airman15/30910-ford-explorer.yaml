    If you're the type that wants ruggedness in a vehicle, look no further than the Ford Explorer!

A vehicle built to carry your equipment across all uncharted territory is a no-brainer! With a fitting name, you'll be able to make your mark in newly discovered lands (so long as your transmission holds together)! Now tell us, what will you explore?
