  summary: Air France A380
  description: |-
    How can you meet demands to carry more people in a single trip without sacrificing luxury or comfort? The answer is simple- build it bigger! Airbus and Air France are stepping in to fill in for this solution and they are ready to take to the airspace above your cities! No longer are sims waiting around in your airport waiting for the next flight to arrive. They are now flying high with style that can only be delivered by an Air France A380!
      

    About the upload-
    This is a replacement for the 707. It comes with two files. One is to be used for Hardware settings and the other is to be used for Software settings. Either one will change the default 707 into an Airbus A380 in Air France colors.
      

    Dependencies?
    None.
