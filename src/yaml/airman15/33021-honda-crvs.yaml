  summary: Honda CR-Vs
  description: |-
    Whether we want to admit it or not, most new cars are horrid. Sure, the latest models have experienced leaps and bounds in safety and they all offer the latest technology everybody wants. But the fact of the matter is, the latest cars have become pointlessly bloated. Newer models keep getting uglier with each passing year. And especially with SUV's, you will only find big, horrid pavement pounders where the most vigorous offroading they see is on a mowed park field. Whatever happened to having a compact, yet capable truck-based wagon? One where you didn't have an SUV unless it had a spare on the back? SUV's used to be fun, do-it-all platforms where you didn't care you had a dirt road ahead. These CR-V's live up to the challenge, and are all you need to put the 'Utility' back in Sport Utility!
