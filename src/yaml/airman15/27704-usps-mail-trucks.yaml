  summary: USPS Mail Trucks
  description: |-
    How was the world built? If you ask anyone, they'll tell you the world has been built because of the idea of trade. In SimCity, nations can be built out of thin air. Sims, like in the real world can travel around and trade in other cities, but what about MAIL? How do sims trade mail in just about any city when no one bothers to drive to the other side of the region? This handy little truck changes that. Though registered in the US, this truck solves the problem of stagnant mail and gets it delivered to their respective recipients. The trucks used may be small, but they are built to last years and take the abuse of driving thousands of miles. Have mail? Need  delivery? We take care of both- United States Postal Service.
    
    About the upload  
      
    This file adds the USPS Mail Truck as not only an AI vehicle, but as a drivable My Sim car for those with Deluxe or Rush Hour. It is a Low Wealth vehicle, and can be driven by your sim no matter the wealth status. The truck is a new instance, meaning it does not replace any existing vehicle. The file should work with Software, eliminating the need for Hardware settings.

    Dependencies?  
      
    None! All you need is the file itself.
