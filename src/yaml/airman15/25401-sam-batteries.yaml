  summary: SAM Batteries V2
  description: |-
    Gatling Cannons are a good choice to take out enemy jets before they can destroy the city, but it turned out that the enemy has stolen B-52s and Tu-160s, and has leveled many cities and destroyed half the capital. Because of this, SNMC (Sim Nation Military Command) with again the help of Dr. Vu has given you the plans to a new type of defense- SAM Sites. The base of the SAM uses the same design as the Gatling Cannon, but instead of Gatling cannons, these defenses use patriot missiles supplied and built by the United States. Not only do these missiles have a better range than Gatling cannons, they are also more accurate and deal even more damage with their explosive warheads. Place a few of these SAM batteries around your city and NOW nothing will get past them, not even high altitude/high speed bombers.  
      
      
    About this file:  
      
    This set includes the SAM props and a separate missile rack. These are static props, so they are eye candy. This prop was placed and tested on a grass lot, so the SAMs will appear in the "parks" menu. Since this is a prop, you can put it on virtually any lot with the Lot Editor.
