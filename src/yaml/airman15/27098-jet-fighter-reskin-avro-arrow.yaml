  summary: Jet Fighter Reskin- Avro Arrow
  description: |-
    **Avro Arrow Reskin**

    When one normally asks a favor, the person being asked will usually be obliged to do so. This can also happen in politics- The Canadian Air Force has lent a squadron of Jet Fighters painted with their markings and are available for your use. These planes are just like the ones used by your own air force, but are painted in a different scheme to prevent confusion amongst pilots.

    The RCAF decided to paint these jets in a scheme once used by the Avro Arrow that was flown in the 50's since their modern grey livery closely resembles most other gray AF schemes nowadays. With this scheme, you will be defending your homeland- Canadian style!

    **About the Upload**

    Its a .DAT file and once you put it into your plugins folder, the file overrides the normal skin of the Jet Fighter at Area 5.1 (or at just about anywhere that also spawns the plane) and now your jets are painted up like Avro Arrows. And since it is a reskin, It will still drop bombs! This new reskin is a "what if" scheme showing what it would look like if the default F-5 was painted just like the Arrow. (This concept at one time wouldn't have been out of the realm of possibility because the RCAF used to fly F-5's several years ago).

    This was requested by Evandad and since Christmas is here, this is my present made available for everyone to download!

    **Dependencies?**

    None, other than the file itself

    Merry Christmas and see you in 2012!
