  summary: Boeing 707 Pack
  description: |-
    Have we come so far in air travel? When in the dawn of aviation, flying was only for a select handful of crazy men willing to push the limits to the skies. Then when airline travel began, it was as if soaring like an eagle was finally within reach. And now in the age of the jet, the Boeing 707 is taking passengers higher and faster than ever before. The unmistakable contours and distinct four engines set the next benchmark in the future of flying.

      

      

    About the upload-

      

    This set features the Boeing 707 as a prop to be placed around custom airports. Each 707 will be found in the airports menu and is ideal for period airports of the 60's and 70's or for aviation buffs who would like to see more classic airliners at the gate.

    Some components for the textures were derived from Libardo Guzman's White Texture Kit for Flight Simulator X. The model itself was entirely my work.

      

      

    I owe another huge thanks to Mike\_Oxlong, whom had helped walked me through the lotting process, as well as put up with my constant whining on technical difficulties.
