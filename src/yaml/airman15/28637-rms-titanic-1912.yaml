  summary: RMS Titanic (1912)
  description: |-
    In 1912, a shipping company known as White Star Line would make history. Their pride and joy was the RMS Titanic, the largest ship in the world at the time. With furnishings to rival the finest estates of the old world, passengers were offered unrivaled comfort on each voyage. The Titanic was to make her first Atlantic crossing from Southampton to New York City via Cherbourg and Queenstown, leaving port on April 10th but four days later at 11:40 PM, Titanic hit an iceberg and as a result of a major design flaw, the ship sank in two hours and forty minutes, taking 1500 lives with her.

    More than a century later, Titanic's legacy lives on through books, movies and memorials around the world. Plans have been made to build full scale replicas of the ship. This upload brings the original Titanic to the waters of SimCity 4.
