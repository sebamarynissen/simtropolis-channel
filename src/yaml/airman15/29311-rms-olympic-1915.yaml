  summary: RMS Olympic (1915)
  description: |-
    Legends have been around since the dawn of time. Some famous, and others infamous but all are immortalized and forever ingrained in the fabric of history. Even in recent history, stories like the RMS Titanic are still remembered through the centuries. But sometimes, the fable can overshadow more of the past. Launched before her ill-fated sister, the RMS Olympic had a fulfilling service life making countless Trans-Atlantic crossings and earning the nickname Old Reliable. She survived the first World War before returning to passenger service and ultimately scrapped in the mid 1930's. But now the Olympic is ready to make a port of call in SimCity 4. What say you? Is your city prepared for the arrival of a once-forgotten legend?

    About the upload-

    This file adds the RMS Olympic as an additional cruise ship. It will appear alongside another cruise ship without replacing it. To differentiate between the Olympic and Titanic (for those using the latter), the Olympic has all-black funnels and a darker superstructure similar to how she looked in the year 1915.
