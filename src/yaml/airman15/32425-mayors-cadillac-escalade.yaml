  summary: Mayor's Cadillac Escalade
  description: |-
    Living the high life can be obtained in a myriad of ways, as long as you have the proper connections or the resources to do so. Yet, when you find your way into that lifestyle your options for vehicles are all the same garish brands that each bring you the same judging sneers from the public at large. But you don't give a Hoover Damn! You feed on it! You earned your position early on and they are only jealous! It doesn't matter if you're a small time rap star, or a failed real estate mogul, or the mayor of Podunk in Whoknowswhere County, you still deserve a chariot from which to show off in!

    About the Upload-  
    The vehicle is a 2017 Cadillac Escalade and is driveable once the Mayor's House is constructed in your city. It is a replacement for the Maxis Mayor's Limousine. Also includes a second matching file for use as standard automata.

    Dependencies?  
    None needed.

    Components for the textures were derived from Kelley Blue Book.
