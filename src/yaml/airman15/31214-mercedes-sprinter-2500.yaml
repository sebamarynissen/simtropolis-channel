  summary: Mercedes Sprinter 2500
  description: |-
    Regardless of what type of economy a city runs, there will always be a need for logistics. It can involve any type of trade that means moving goods or equipment or anything else that needs to follow through from Point "A" to point "B". And to make it happen, you'll need a reliable vehicle with ample space that will take the abuse of moving from one place to another. That is what the Mercedes Sprinter is built for!

    About the Upload-  
    There are three vehicles contained in this zip folder. Each one is a 2013 Mercedes Sprinter 2500. The Sprinters come in three basic colors so they would blend into almost any setting. These vehicles will appear on your road networks.
