  summary: Initial-D AE86 Trueno
  description: |-
    There's nothing quite like the adrenaline rush in street racing! Speed limits are rather trivial when you're focused on trying to turn the corner just right. And right-of-ways are not necessary when you and your opponent are fighting to win. I'm sure your father won't mind that you borrow his old Toyota, just get out there and get ahead!

    About the upload-  
    This file adds the Toyota AE86 Trueno from Initial D to your road traffic. It will spawn as a low-wealth vehicle but the speed has been changed to match the Maxis Porche making it a faster vehicle.

    Dependencies?   
    None required.

    This file was a request from Markthrash and has been made available for all to download!  
    The textures were sourced from Legacy DieCast screenshots.
