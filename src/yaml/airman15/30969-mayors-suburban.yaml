  summary: Mayor's Suburban
  description: |-
    Ah, fame and fortune! One of the most sought after lifestyles on earth. And holding the title of Mayor provides a great stepping stone to it. But even the very best have their limits in taste- I mean, who rides in limousines anymore? Constantly needing to avoid wide turns and getting stuck on shallow inclines alone have prompted the elite to transfer to a more sensible means of transportation. The Chevrolet Suburban provides a touch of class all the while providing ample room for more of your friends and fans.

    About the upload:  
    This file is a replacement for the Maxis Mayor's Limousine. The vehicle is a 2011 Chevrolet Suburban and is drivable once the Mayor's House is constructed in your city.
