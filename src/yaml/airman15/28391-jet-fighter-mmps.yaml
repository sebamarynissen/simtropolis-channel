  description: |-
    Look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it Superman? Nope- its more fighter jets ready to watch the skies! This collection of MMPs include aircraft postitoned either on the ground or in the air (200m up, to be exact). In this lovely package, you will have aircraft from the United States, Soviet Union and China. The jets included are:

    F-14 Tomcat

    F-15 Eagle

    F-16 Fighting Falcon

    F/A-18 Hornet

    YF-22 Raptor

    F-35 Lightning II

    J-20 Annihilator

    MiG-21 Fishbed

    MiG-25 Foxbat

    MiG-29 Fulcrum

    PAK/FA

    SU-47 Berkut

    Since these jets are MMPs, they can be placed just about anywhere in any arrangement. The MMPs are ideal for RMIP sets and CJ use.

    Dependencies?

    None.

    Installation:

    Just unzip the file and place them in your plugins folder.

    Credits:

    Special thanks to GN\_Leugim for rendering the models and modding

    And another special thanks to Schulmanator for featuring these jets

    in his CJ Schulmania.
