  summary: Small Solar Plants
  description: |-
    Tired of having so little space in you cities? Sick of big, bulky power plants that cause pollution? And are you fed up with wind power plants being as useful as a pencil without lead? You don't have to loathe any longer, Mayor! Introducing Solar Panels! But there are solar plants around, what's the difference? You can have all the power you need by just plopping a few of these babies around. It sounds too good to be true, but it is true! You can now make use of empty spaces (assuming they have good lighting) while being pollutant free! So what do you say Mayor? Shall we have your signature of approval?

    About the file:

    This is a custom lot meant to serve as an alternative to wind power plants. They take up less space and are meant to produce a little more energy than a wind turbine. These would be great when you're just staring a city.

    Dependencies?
