  summary: Jaden Smith Tweets- Loading Text Mod
  description: |-
    We've all had to go through it- that phase where we think we know everything but to everyone else we have no idea what we're talking about. Such is the case with Jaden Smith, son of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and philosophy extraordinaire. This collection of tweets may be the most profound quotes of this modern century, or it's more likely showing consequences of injecting four whole marijuanas each day. Though it may be a testament to all of the stupidity we like to post on social media, his tweets should help you think while you pass the time when waiting for a city to load. Maybe by the time your metropolis is loaded, you can finally answer how mirrors can be real if our eyes aren't real.

    About the upload-

    This is a replacement for the text that appears as you are loading a city tile. Each and every one was copied verbatim (punctual errors included) from @officialjaden, the verified Twitter profile of Jaden Smith.

    Dependencies?

    None.

    This mod was based on Craig-Abcvs' Text Loading Mod. The idea came from \_\_B and to mark his return to Twitter, I thought it was appropriate to make it reality.
