#   summary: United Simnations Air Force One
#   description: |-
#     In the modern world, nations must maintain contact twenty-four hours a day. But visiting your buddies who run an allied nation halfway across the world isn't exactly a convenient experience- at least until now. The United Simnations has commissioned their first VIP jets to allow USN diplomats as well as government officials to travel quickly and comfortably. No longer will half a day be wasted trying to cross an ocean or clear the badlands, these jets will efficiently navigate the globe and make international politics more efficient as well.
      

#     About the upload-
#     This upload comes with two files. The lots are similar, with one having a motorcade and one without. The lots are designed for modular airports that utilize the RMIP. The lots included will be found under the 'Landmarks' menu. The aircraft itself is a static prop.
      

#     Dependencies?
#     The following downloads are required to ensure this lot works properly:
#     [RMIP Vol. 2](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26571-rmip-2-sae-vol-2/)
#     [ACBVLT Terminals and Jets Series 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/18477-acb-vlt-terminals-and-jets-series-1-part-1/)
      

#     Installation:
#     Just extract the file into your plugins folder. The lots should appear in the Landmarks folder.
      

#     Special thanks to SimRico, whom has requested this file and has featured it in his City Journal Peyton Place. 
#     This file was inspired by, and based on [Halo1dragon's Air Force One](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23541-air-force-one/).
#     The model for Air Force One is part of the game HAWX and therefore belongs to Ubisoft.
