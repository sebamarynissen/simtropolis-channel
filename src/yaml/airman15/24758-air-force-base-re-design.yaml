  summary: Air Force Base Re-Design
  description: |-
    Is your region threatened by terrorists? Are conflicts between you and your neighbor starting to become ugly? Or is a rouge nation out to try and destroy you? Fear not! The Sim Nation Military Command has come up with a way to help better protect your city! Your army base is not going to be the only thing that protects your cities, because you will now have an air force protecting the skies above you. And shall you win the day, or if you want to show what you've got, Airshows will perform for the thousands of people watching from below. Rest easy, Mayor! Knowing you've got a strong Air Force watching over your city.

    About the file:
