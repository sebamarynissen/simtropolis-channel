  summary: Air France Airbus A350
  description: |-
    We understand. The hassle of going through the airport security. The long wait times for your flight to arrive. And then boarding just to wait for the time you'll arrive at your destination. Airline travel hasn't been one of the most painless experiences; and it's about to change for the better. Designed to offer a much more relaxing flight, and featuring the greenest and most advanced aeronautical engineering to date.
