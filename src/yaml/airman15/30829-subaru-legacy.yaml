  summary: Subaru Legacy
  description: |-
    So you've got a penchant for fun, and practicality. You've saved up enough to buy a car and what's out on the market? Gas guzzlers, soccer-mom-mobiles, cars that require detailing after every trip, you get the idea. Consider a Subaru Legacy! Whether you're the outdoorsy type that lives for the campground or the sporty type with a thirst for adrenaline this car fits the best of both worlds!

    About the upload-  
    There are twelve vehicles contained in this zip folder. Each one is a Subaru Legacy, with six of them being 1997 station wagons and the other six being 1998 sedans. These are Low-Wealth vehicles (given their average Blue Book for their respective years) and will appear on your road networks.

    Dependencies?  
    None Required.
