    About the upload-

    This upload is meant to add the USS Macon as a replacement for the Maxis blimp. There are several files included:

    -   The Macon with a fighter escort.
    -   The Macon by itself.
    -   The Curtiss Sparrowhawk, which replaces the Sky Writer.

    Some history; The USS Macon, as well as the USS Akron were airships built by the US Navy. They were built for reconnaissance and had the feature to launch and recover biplanes without needing a ship or an airfield. This was performed with a trapeze system on which the fighters (Sparrowhawks) were suspended from a bar and hanged with a guide & hook. Then in 1935, the USS Macon was caught in a storm off the California shore and wrecked in the ocean. The USS Akron suffered a similar fate two years prior off the eastern seaboard.
