  summary: Infiniti Q50
  description: |-
    An emblem is arguably more of a status symbol than the car it's glued to. You've already saved enough to upgrade your sedan outright and what's on the market? An endless stream of cookie-cutter plastic junk that still have tape decks! That simply won't do, not as long as you want to gloat to your friends at the country club. Why should you have to stand for car that everyone and their mothers own? You're the CEO, you cannot have the same types of cars your employees drive! It just wouldn't be right! Buy the Infiniti; earn the right to say your repair bills are more than most people's rent!
