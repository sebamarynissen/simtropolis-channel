  summary: Cessna Citation Mustang
  description: |-
    A staple of reaching ultimate luxury means owning a private jet. Every sim who isn't rich wishes they had one, but the millionaires wish they had something better to choose from than a cramped sardine can built 50 years ago. It's time to meet the Cessna Citation Mustang! Better comfort, a quiet interior and a more pleasing paint scheme are just three of many reasons why jet owners are dropping their old Sabreliners and switching to the new Citation Mustang. Why settle for anything other than a Cessna?  
      
    About the Upload-  
    This is a simple mod that overrides the original business jet. This file is also a revisiting of an early file released in 2012 and is an entirely rebuilt model with new textures (based on the High Sierra Edition). There are two files included.  
      
    Dependencies?
