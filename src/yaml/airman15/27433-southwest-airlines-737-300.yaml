  summary: Southwest Airlines 737-300
  description: |-
    Tired of having to deal with hidden charges on top of having to sacrifice and arm and leg for airline tickets? Don't you wish there was an easy and inexpensive way to fly across the nation? Southwest Airlines is the go-to for many travelers in the United States, and for good reason! Southwest Airlines lets your luggage fly for free and every flight comes with a complimentary drink and snack! You don't have to buy into the inconveniences offered by all other airlines, and you don't have to crawl for great distances on the ground either. Spread the love, fly Southwest today!  
      
    About the upload-  
    This is a revisiting of an older project which replaces the Maxis midjet. This file features an entirely new model and updated textures. Only one file at a time can be used. I've tried every possible method to make these jets separate instances but only one jet wants to appear at a time. I hope to rectify the problem to be co-existent in the future. If you have questions, comments or any knowledge on how to resolve this problem, please PM me!  
      
    Dependencies?  
    None needed.  
      
    The model was made by myself; Textures were sourced from a set of custom textures for Flight Simulator 2004, and were created by Jeroen Godee.
