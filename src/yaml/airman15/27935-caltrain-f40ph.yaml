  summary: CalTrain F40PH
  description: |-
    If you ask anyone about trains, they will tell you that having a rail network is important for developing/connecting cities and empires and sending goods across the land. This is very true and rail lines still play an important role in the modern world. Unfortunately, what Maxis gave us was a fat, ugly blue and white hunk of metal that might be the reason why sims try so hard to avoid riding trains. Meet the F40PH! Reliable, tough and good looking, these metal monsters will make sims want to ride them.. especially on F40PH Friday!   
      
      
    About the upload:  
      
    The .DAT file will change whatever locomative you have into an F40PH sporting CalTrain colors. This is ideal for those working on the Bay Area region. You can still drive it, this is only a model/skin change reverse-engineered from i-photon's P42-DC.  
      
      
    Dependencies?  
      
    None, however it is highly recommended that you use Big Red Fish's  
    Train Set, which includes train cars in CalTrain colors.
