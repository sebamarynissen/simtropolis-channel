  summary: UH-1 Iroquois "Huey"
  description: |-
    In the battle for tomorrow, there are often many challenges which must be overcome. Many times in war, the terrain has been a deciding factor in the final outcome. In a treacherous setting with steep mountains, winding valleys and dense foliage it can be very difficult to move units to the next rally point. Until now, the UH-1 Iroquois also known as the Huey can bypass even the most dangerous trails by air, cutting down travel time and proving to be a very resilient chopper in both cargo and frontline duties.
