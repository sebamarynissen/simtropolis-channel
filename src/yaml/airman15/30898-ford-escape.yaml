  summary: Ford Escape
  description: |-
    Five doors with added cargo space in the back, and built upon a sturdy all-terrain platform. This is the gist of a Sport Utility Vehicle. But sometimes you don't need to follow the "Bigger is Better" philosophy. The Ford Escape is the perfect vehicle in looking for both versatility and practicality. No need to overstuff your old wagon, the Ford Escape can do it all!
