  summary: Pan Am DC-10
  description: |-
    "Space Ship. That's our DC-10. With space to move around. Space to relax. Stretch out. Even more space to see out, because the DC-10 has the largest windows of any commercial jetliner. And you can cover more space in a DC-10, too. Dc-10's fly to more cities, more often than any wide-cabin jet. So next trip, ask for the Space Ship. A DC-10. Chosen by more than 40 airlines around the world. You couldn't ask for more than the DC-10."

    \-McDonnell Douglas, 1970's advertisement.  
      
    About the upload-  
    This is a revisiting of an older file I released back in 2012. It is a completely reconstructed model, including accurate proportions, better detailing, and new textures. It is an entirely new package that only shares the name and airline with the old model.  
      
    Dependencies?  
    None Required.
