  summary: Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk
  description: |-
    Paved roads are built to accommodate all types of vehicles. Millions of people in all corners of the world use them for every trip that requires someone to be behind the wheel. Unfortunately, all those concrete ribbons that cut across the landscape just seem.. boring.. The Jeep Cherokee is here to change that. The fun in driving should involve blazing your own trails! It should be taking that risk in fording that river! And it should continue until you find that perfect campsite overlooking the entire valley!
