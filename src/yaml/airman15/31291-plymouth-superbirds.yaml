  description: |-
    If speed is your calling, you'll need to choose your car wisely. Can you dig it? While most of your gearhead friends have cheap imports they modified on their own or brought their old man's Chevy to the track, you went for far-out aerodynamics. Don't get tripped up on the funky wing or pointed nose, Daddy-o! This masterpiece by Plymouth rocked the circuit to the max, back in the day with the likes of Richard Petty! And now it can be yours to show up everyone at the local car meet, too!
