  summary: Chevrolet S10's
  description: |-
    Transporting cargo is not an easy task. There isn't any room to make an annoying task any more complicated. While large trucks are great for the heavy long hauls, it doesn't make sense to drive one for simpler deliveries with smaller loads. Meet the Chevrolet S10- a small, lightweight truck which serves as a flexible platform perfect for short hauls and perfect for camping trips! It goes to show you can do it all, and not always need a truck that's twelve yards long and two lanes wide!
