  description: |-
    We have to go back! Back to the past, so we can go back to Back to the Future. The way I see it, if you're going to build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style? Powered with 1.21 Gigawatts, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious stuff! Just remember to pack some extra Plutonium for the ride home. Or some weather reports if you need a lightning storm!

    About the upload-

    There are two files included. One file adds a stock DeLorean to the game while the second file adds the DeLorean Time Machine from the Back to the Future trilogy. They will be found on the roads of your city. This file is a revisiting of a DeLorean that was released two years back in order to give it a better model, better textures and the time machine variant. You could say I was a slacker. 

    Sorry, hoverboards not included.

    Dependencies?

    None required.
