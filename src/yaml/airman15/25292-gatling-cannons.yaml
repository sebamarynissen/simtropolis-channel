  summary: Gatling Cannons
  description: |-
    So your nation has gone to war. The enemy has soldiers, ships and planes ready to invade you, and your entire military has been outnumbered and outgunned. So what do you do now? The enemy is coming and you don't have enough time to assemble enough forces to defend you. Luckily, the Sim Nation Military Command has created a solution to help stop the enemy. The SNMC (with the help of Dr. Vu) has given you the plans and parts to create probably the deadliest defense structure in the world: Gatling Cannons. Each one has 6 cannons (3 on each turret) and a very far firing range. Just plop a few of these babies around your city and nothing will get past them... just pray they don't have high altitude or high speed bombers..

    This is a static prop, and this is the first prop I created. This prop was placed and tested on a dirt lot, so the cannons will appear in the "parks" menu.
