#   summary: HAWX Air Force One
#   description: |-
#     How can your city gain recognition? The answer is simple- have a high profile figure come for a visit. And not an assembly-line movie star or a millionaire playboy will cut it. You need someone of an almost unmatched caliber to visit, like a President. In fact, the President of the United States wants to take a vacation in your city and he is sure to make quite an entrance in his new ride. To welcome his arrival, there is a crowd of people that are happy to see him as well as others who aren't so happy with his arrival waiting for him.
      

#     About the upload-
#     This is a landmark lot to show Air Force One from HAWX parked on the tarmac. It comes complete with the President and his bodyguards, some airport vehicles and a motorcade. This lot is designed for modular airports that utilize the RMIP. The lots included will be found under the 'Landmarks' menu.
      

#     Dependencies?
#     Yes. The following downloads are required to ensure this lot works without problems:
#     [RMIP Vol. 2](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26571-rmip-2-sae-vol-2/)
#     [ACBVLT Terminals and Jets Series 1](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/18477-acb-vlt-terminals-and-jets-series-1-part-1/)
      

#     For the blank template, you will need the [Building Architect Tool (BAT)](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?page=14) to render the model. The texture file included can be edited with any photo manipulator.
      

#     Installation:
#     Just extract the file into your plugins folder. This lot should appear in the Landmarks folder.
      

#     If you wish to have a custom livery but are unsure how to use the BAT, Please PM me.
#     This file was inspired by, and based on Halo1dragon's Air Force one.
#     The model and textures for Air Force One are part of the game HAWX and therefore belongs to Ubisoft.
