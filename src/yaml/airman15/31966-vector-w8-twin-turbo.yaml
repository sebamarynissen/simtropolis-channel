  summary: Vector W8 Twin Turbo
  description: |-
    How nostalgic it is to reflect upon what happened during the most epic track tournaments organized! Passion engulfs favorite auto brands, particularly around the peak performers in the industry. To have that experience of being behind the wheel of a Ferrari, in the same place as Shumacher is a lucid dream within racing culture. Yet, you can only reminisce upon those races for so long before you have the next grand prix on the calendar. And don't expect it to end the same every time. In the Vector W8, the trophy is now anyone's prize. It is here to cast legacies into jeopardy. The fight to keep the racing titans in your mirror brings quite possibly the best feelings to experience! The second best comes after you make the drive home without catching fire.
