  summary: Totem pole
  description: |-
    This totem pole was requested by pmiller and can be placed in any park or camp area you like. If you are making an American region and would like to show some appreciation for the Native American Indians you should use this prop. The top part of the totem pole is an eagle and the bottom are the different faces on the totem pole.

    Please be sure to read the installation instructions included in the file.

    Thanks to all the people who helped me make this totem pole.

    This totem pole is a prop and can be placed on any lot you wish.
