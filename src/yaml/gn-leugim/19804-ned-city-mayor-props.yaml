    Aren't you tired of scrolling through dozens of parks? Or to go to Lot Editor every time you got a new idea for a park? all to give you some customization in your city??

    well, this is for you!!! with this mod, you only need to plop the base ground (plaza, grass, whatever..) and use this plops to add variety to your city.

    in the picture, all you can see but the light and fences, are CMP

    this set is only the first one of many. On it, you will find 4 different types of plops:

    1-Statues (yellow line)

    2-Mesas (Green line)

    3-Statues (blue line)

    4-a Bench (red cycle)

    they fallow the method very used for many people already, you click for first model, click again and it changes and so on.. one other good stuff is the capability of orient the Bench and the last Statue, by clicking on it! try, and you will see =)

    hope you like CMP from NewEra Developments, and keep looking ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
