    This is (and I hope it to be the only one) dependency pack from me. here you will find (most of them Portuguese) textures and props, and most of my next releases will need this one.

    It includes a Cleanitol file, so when installing it, run it ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)

    Check for the updates, this will be only file.. you can see the version on the top.
