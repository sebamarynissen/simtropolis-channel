    EBLTeam proudly presents,

    European house Add-on's latest addition:

    **Germinated Houses**

    European house Add-on is an effort to make your city's more variable in terms of housing, commercial and industry without either filling much your plugins folder nor unbalance the game. This is archived by a simply addition to the maxis original building families, which allows you to have more buildings and at the same time less space taken by dependencies and lot files.

    This building was made in accordance with the size of the Maxi's original building and it's occupant capacity. The rest of the values were archived using the PIM\-X, which provides the best balanced values possible at the moment.

    This building is also multi-language, supporting at least Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, English (UK and USA) and German. But other languages may be included.

    For further information see the enclosed Readme file or visit the EHA thread at [Simtropolis](https://community.simtropolis.com/topic/39797-european-house-add-on-eha-thread/) or at [SC4Devotion](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=14988.0)

    Rates and Comments are welcome.

    Enjoy, Gn\_Leugim
