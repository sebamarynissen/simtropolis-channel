  summary: Forest Parks ver2
  description: |-
    This is the second release of my forest parks, this time with new icons, names, descriptions and configurations

    new lots added:

    \-all old lots also included

    \-1x1 oak trees

    \-2x2 oak trees

    this lots have some landmark and park effect, but work better as air pollution cleaners, especially the 2x2 lots

    dependencies:

    [BSC CP PropPack Vol 01](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=14842)

    PS: oak family file is included on the my dat. as i had to change his slope configs, all credits to his creator.

    hope you enjoy and rate =P
