  description: |-
    I've being looking in ST and couldn't find something like this. so I made it, and gonna hare it..

    This set has some plazas, all with sandstone texture to blend with the NAM ped piece as well with the sidewalk mod.. there are 1 bare 1x1 lot, 3 1x1 plaza, 2 2x2 plazas and 1 3x3 plaza..

    stats are the same as the same size maxis plazas, and have custom icons and descriptions..
