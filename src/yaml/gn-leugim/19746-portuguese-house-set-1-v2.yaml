  summary: Updated portuguese house set
  description: |-
    update: changed the configuration of the twin houses, making it only possible to grow in medium density and above..

    well... it's been an year since my first release XD

    so, i though about to celebrate it, and i remade my first release, the portuguese house set 1..

    in it, i re-textured all buildings, remodel some, lotted some new lots and fixed a bug which prevented the "twin Houses" t appear

    when installing. just unzip the .dat file and replace the older one with the new.. you won't need to bulldoze or wait for something to grow, it works right the way and replaces all the existing in game lots/buildings for the new ones

    hope you enjoy =)

    comments and rates are welcome

    and..

    happy birthday to me XD (and to my brother's kid who's birthday is today too ^^)
