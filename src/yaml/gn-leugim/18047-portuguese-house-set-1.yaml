    Well.. this is my first upload hehe..

    with his first update..

    as I have said, I was working in remaking this one.. so models are a bit bigger, with darker and new textures.. I have added two new models to the set.

    this set now contains:

    -   8 models, 6 low R$, 1 low R$$ and 1 medium R$;  
        
    -   31 lots (with 1x3 now)  
        

    no dependencies.. I try to be nice =)

    I hope you enjoy...
