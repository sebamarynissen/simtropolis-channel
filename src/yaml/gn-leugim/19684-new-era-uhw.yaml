    First of all, sorry for my lazy English

    This is the 2nd release of my Under HighWay set. This set was made to fill elevated highways ground with overhanging textures, but it will do with almost all elevated systems. Keep looking for NewEra realness weekly ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)
