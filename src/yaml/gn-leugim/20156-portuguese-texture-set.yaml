  summary: Portuguese texture set
  description: |-
    I bring you a new pack with/for Portuguese stuff..

    this pack contains:

    \-a sidewalk texture replacement, for all wealths, with Portuguese sidewalks, very discrete and not colourful like some

    \-a texture set with some textures(some equal to the sidewalk mod)

    \-some changed parks to fit with the new sidewalk

    \-plazas (1x1, 2x2, 3x3)

    \-a Portuguese park (original author Wolf\_pt)

    \-new concrete parks with new textures

    \-a bench prop for bonus (you wont need this if you have dl my previous "NED City Mayor Props", as you can find this prop item there)

    now, the dependencies:

    \-you wont need anyone for the textures packs, but for the parks you will..

    \-you need the texture pack for all the parks

    \-for the plaza 3x3 you need both [these trees](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=14842) and the bench prop(provided)

    \-for the Portuguese park, you need the [these props](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/downloads/getfile_pri.php?filename=dayopeace.dat)

    hope you like.. comment and rate plz
