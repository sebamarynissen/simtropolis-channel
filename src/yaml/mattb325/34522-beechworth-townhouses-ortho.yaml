    **Beechworth Townhouses, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    These are modern townhouses that you see popping up everywhere.

    Two stories in height, they are compact in design. But despite their diminutive size, they still manage to have a single car garage (usually a luxury in the inner city), an open plan living/dining and kitchen space as well as two bedrooms and a bathroom on the upper floor.

    I made these due to a lack of modern R$$ 1x1 medium density dwellings in game. They will also be a dependency for upcoming lots.

    They grow on a 1x1 lot on the Houston and Euro tilesets only.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
