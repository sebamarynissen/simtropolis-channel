    **Former American Cement Building, by Mattb325.**  
    \---------------------------------------

    While this is not a recreation, this building draws heavy inspiration from the American Cement Building on Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles.

    This particular building style was very popular in the 1960's and features a complex concrete latticework exo-skeleton and raised parking platform. Such treatment, as well as being decorative, provided additional structural integrity.

    Despite being a very common place design, they are very under-represented in SC4.

    It is on a 4x3 and 4x4 lot as a high-wealth commercial office (CO§§§) for medium and high density zones.

    It is offered as a growable mid-rise building only - on all tilesets - and competes well with many of the Maxis mid-rises.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either:
