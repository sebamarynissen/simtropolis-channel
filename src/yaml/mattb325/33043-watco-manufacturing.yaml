    **Watco Manufacturing, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A typical manufacturing 'unit' that you find in all light industrial areas around the world.

    Watco is most famous for making a product called Bitu-mend; a product that is super-quick and easy to fill all sizes of road pot-holes straight out of the tin.

    Most manufacturing Bats available are large grungy looking buildings: I made this as a building suitable for areas near residential development. This building is in fact a scaled-down version of the real Watco in Independence, MO.

    It is presented as a simple, no-frills 3x3 growable I-M anchor lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
