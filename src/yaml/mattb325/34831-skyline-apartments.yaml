    **Skyline Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a purely fictional design for an 18 floor apartment complex suitable for inner-city areas.

    While all of the apartments benefit from floor-to-ceiling windows, an otherwise basic facade is given visual interest with angled terraces (executed in a bronze-tinted glass) as well as staggered cubes on each elevation.

    It is offered in two versions: CS$$ (as this will also work as a hotel design, and enables you to plop this down using Buggis extra cheats) and an R$$ apartment on the modern Houston and Euro tilesets.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
