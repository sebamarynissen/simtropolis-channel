    **Tree Farm, by Mattb325.**

    **\---------------------------------------**

    These are two Eucalyptus tree farms.

    From Australia to Europe and Britain, Guangdong to California, Brazil to Pretoria, Eucalyptus trees are often farmed for the express purpose of making wood pulp. These trees are quick growing and despite their propensity to drop branches and topple in storms, their timber is durable.

    Loved and hated in both Australia and abroad, Eucalyptus trees trace their lineage back to the Gondwanaland super-continent with all the fossil evidence (dating back about 60 million years) showing that Eucalyptus evolved somewhere around present day Argentina/Uruguay and spread eastwards some 180-50 million years ago. This was when South America was joined to South Australia via Antarctica.

    Ironically, in their ancestral home, Eucalyptus trees are now considered a monumental pest in South America and many other parts of the world. Just like Australian actors, they are everywhere.

    Theses farm lots are arranged with a cute, but modest house and the house and outbuildings are set well back from the road via a long driveway. One of the things that bugs me about farms in SC4 is that the farm buildings are right on the roadside: something rarely seen in real life.

    These are not designed to grow too frequently (assuming you have other custom farms in your plugins). It also comes with a brand new type of farm field for the Eucalyptus tree prop family.

    *Mattb325 Edit April 6 2021: It has been reported where if you de-zone or zone over the top of the grown fields (eg to make residential areas for instance), the trees remain in place: simply bulldoze them after dezoning. Similarly, you need to dezone the entire area first prior to bulldozing the fields.*

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download is a lot and contains no models. However, the dependency will require you to choose between a Maxis nite model and a Darknite model. If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
