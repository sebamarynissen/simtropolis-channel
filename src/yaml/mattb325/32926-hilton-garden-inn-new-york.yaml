    **Hilton Garden Inn New York, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This high-rise hotel fills a gap in the paucity of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any additional growth at all.

    This building is inspired by the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel on W35th Street near Macys. It is a basic New York 20th Century high rise box: brick construction, aluminium windows and a recent 'renovation' by the Hilton group has given it decorative coloured glass elements along the street facade.

    In reality it is a tall W2W building with two blank brick walls on either side (yuck) so I have given the building windows on both sides.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 2x2 and 2x3 high-density lot providing 524 jobs. It grows only on the New York Tileset so shouldn't become too weedy. If you want this as a ploppable, a recommend downloading buggis extra cheats and then selecting it via the 'buildingplop' option.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
