    **Bergen Fish Market & Tourist Information Center, by Mattb325.  
    \-----------------------------------------------------------**

    While the combination of a fish market and tourist information center might seem a little peculiar, it is indeed, a real thing.

    Inspired by the Bergen Fish market, this building acts as a reward. Almost shaped like a wedge of sushi, it is clad in dark timber that is punctuated by brightly colored fins that light up at night.

    I have this building an overhanging prop: when placed, the cantilevered section can overhang the water, piers, seawalls/marinas, roads, streets, etc, for a more dramatic effect.

    This building is offered as a non-conditional reward that has a somewhat similar base function to the farmer's market (but is altered substantially). It provides 31 very desirable civic jobs, boosts commercial and residential demand and lifts caps for R$ and R$$ residents so is a great option to help when residential demand drops.

    This building is:  
    \* Offered as a reward without needing to meet pre-existing conditions.  
    \* Located in the REWARD Menu   
    \* Can be placed more than once in a city.   
    \* It DOES NOT over-write any ingame or custom rewards.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    The main dependency pack for all of these Civic Bats are split into two dependency files; one is for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos or Mashty's night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must select and install only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
