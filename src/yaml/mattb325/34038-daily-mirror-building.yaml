    **The Daily Mirror, Los Angeles, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The Daily Mirror building is part of a much larger Los Angeles Times newspaper complex. Known as the Crawford addition, it was built in 1948.

    This 11-floor building is done in the functional *streamline moderne* style and makes for an interesting art-deco inspired mid-rise building.

    It is offered as a growable medium wealth commercial services building on a 2x3 lot that will employ 825 workers. If you wish to make this ploppable, I suggest downloading Buggis extra cheats which will make this (and everything else in your plugins) available to plop from a drop-down list.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
