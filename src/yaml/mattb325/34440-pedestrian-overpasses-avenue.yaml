    **Pedestrian Overpass (Avenue), by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A set of three pedestrian overpass bridges found in the parks menu. These bridges are in a lot family and you will get a different one each time you plop (thus reducing clutter in the already crowded parks menu).

    Two of these bridges are inspired by JBSimio's unreleased work: ten years ago he made a number of eye candy pedestrian footbridges to tie in with the BSC parks series.

    While his work was the inspiration, these pedestrian bridges do not force you to use any type of park.

    The lot has a transparent base and can be **placed on ground or on water, making them quite unique**.

    To place, make a 2-tile wide viaduct using the 15m hole digger lot that comes with the NAM, and then place the 1x1 lot on the slope: the bridge piece is overhanging and will span the gap between the two sides. It means that the single lot can be used for road/avenue/NWM pieces/Highway/rail, etc. Even ploppable canal water will work.

    You can then use any of your favourite wall pieces (or MMPs) to decorate the slope along the viaduct (as I have done in the images).

    Similarly, if placing this across ingame water, just use the hole digger pieces until you hit water and place the 1x1 on the slope: as long as the water is two tiles wide, the bridge will fill the gap between both banks of the river. You can make real-water canals very easily using this method and these bridges have tight lods so that they can sit correctly in the water.

    The bridges will work with any other depths (such as 7.5m), but visually they look best with 15m heights.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
