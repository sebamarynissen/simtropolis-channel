    **AMP Tower Sydney Cove, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    There are a number of 'AMP' branded buildings in Sydney, but this iconic tower in Sydney's Circular Quay ushered in the modern age for Sydney's skyscraper building.   
    When this building was constructed in the early 1960's, it was more than twice the height of any other building in Sydney and permission to break ground required a intense lobbying from the late 1950's and a special bill to be passed in Parliament to allow construction to proceed. As part of the approval process, the building footprint was only permitted to occupy 55% of the site.

    The tower has stood as the gateway to Sydney's CBD from the harbour for almost 70 years and has been heritage listed.

    While I have modeled this reasonably accurately, as usual, I take artistic liberties as I see fit, so it is not a 100% recreation, but pretty close. I liked the building because it offers a slightly different elevation on each side and with its curved facade mirroring the curve of circular quay, it isn't the typical boring box skyscraper.

    It is offered as a growable CO§§§ (which actually does grow) on a 4x4 lot for high density commercial zones and provides 2,237 high wealth jobs. If you wish to have a ploppable, simply use Buggis extra cheats to easily select this from the Buildingplop or Lotplop options.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
