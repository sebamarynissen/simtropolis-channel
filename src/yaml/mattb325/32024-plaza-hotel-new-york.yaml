    **Plaza Hotel New York, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Like so many buildings in New York city, the Plaza Hotel can claim 'icon' status.

    This 20-story landmark building opened in 1907 on Central Park South and the main entrance faces the Grand Army Plaza (from which the Plaza Hotel derives its name).

    The building is in a French Renaissance Chateau style. It was extended in 1921 with the addition of a 300 room annexe along W58th St.

    This is a complex building - indeed one of the more complex buildings I have batted - with no two elevations the same.   
    While the BAT I have made is a fairly faithful interpretation of the real Plaza hotel, in order to get this into a game constrained by 16m2 tiles, I have had to reinterpret some elements of the building.

    The main areas that have been deliberately altered  to ensure that this is a good and useful game asset (rather than a strict recreation) are most evident along the W58th St side, which in real life is longer than the Central Park Side.   
    To that end I have taken off approx 10m along the W58th St frontage which ensures that the building sits comfortably on 5 tiles and added a matching roof turret for symmetry.   
    The front elevation is slightly narrower than the original to ensure that it sits within a 4 tile space. This is to ensure that other W2W buildings, which are typically 2 tiles deep can grow (or be plopped) adjacent to the building and neatly align (as per the screenshots).  
    Lastly, the roof junk has been deliberately streamlined and simplified to avoid the very cluttered roof-top look of the original building.

    All that said, if you believe that a recreation must be 100% accurate, then this BAT is not for you, as I have made the changes to the building in order to ensure that it is a *good and useful game* asset.

    The building comes in a growable CS§§§ 4x5 lot, a ploppable CS§§§ 4x5 lot and a growable R§§§ 4x5 lot.  
       
    It grows on the New York tileset and given that is an oversized Chateau, in my opinion would work equally well in a Euro environment.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    \* Dayopeace.dat

    N.B: this is for the moving flag props and is one of the Maxis files that were available on the official exchange. Most users will have this. However, if you don't, it is available here: [https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/%C2%A0)  
    Scroll until you see the 'Day of Peace' and then click on the link. You do not need a drop-box account to download the file (you can dismiss the account creation request and download this as a guest).

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **NOTE ABOUT PARKING TEXTURES:**

    There are none. Your driver circles the block while you and your guests dine inside at the Palm Court. If you don't understand this concept, then don't download ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;)")
