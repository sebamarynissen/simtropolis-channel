    **Bullocks Wilshire Blvd Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Another building from 'old' Los Angeles' miracle mile.

    Located at 3050 Wilshire Boulevard in L.A, this building was completed in 1929 as a luxury department store for John G Bullock.

    It is a wonderful example of high art-deco architecture with complex massing and is notable for its 73m tower which is sheathed in copper. While this luxury department store thrived for many decades, its wealth began to decline after the 1970s and, during the L.A. riots of 1992, its ground floor was trashed.

    In 1993, Bullocks Wilshire closed and by 1995 it was converted to a law-school.

    The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

    It is offered as a growable high-wealth commercial services (CS§§§) building only - a 6x6 lot on all tilesets. Use the CTRL key while zoning to assist growth. If you wish to make it ploppable, just download Buggis Extra Cheats.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
