    **Astra Zeneca Laboratory by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    As the world waits for the roll-outs of vaccines to combat the effects of the pandemic and enjoy a return to a semblance of normal life, I thought I would make a BAT of one of the companies responsible.

    There are many companies making vaccines around the globe: Astra Zeneca is one of them.

    This is one of their many laboratories in the UK.

    I don't know if this one is making the vaccine or something far more benign like antacid, but for the purposes of SC4, let's assume it is...  
       
    I liked the decidedly domestic scale of this industrial building which will blend into a suburban location of high-tech industry.

    The building is offered as an I-HT growable Anchor on a 4x4 lot (use the CTRL key while zoning dense industrial to assist in growth).

    It is suited to both CAM and non-CAM cities and provides 292 Hi Tech jobs.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **STATS I-HT:**

    Lot size :                 4x4  
    Growth Stage:        3 (High Density Zoning)  
    Bulldoze Cost:        $ 274  
    Capacity Satisfied: I-HT 292  
    Pollution:                 7 (Air)/ 2 (Water)/ 4 (Garbage )  
    Pollution Radius:    6/7/0

    Water Consumed:  49 Gal/Month  
    Occupant Group:    Industrial Hi-Tech Anchor Building

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    There are no dependencies required.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    To install, simply unzip the contents of this file into your plugins folder.

    *Lastly, if you believe that the COVID-19 virus is a hoax, is engineered, or is part of a broader QAnon etc, conspiracy, that's fine: don't rate or download the model and please keep such comments to yourself. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;)") This is just a little IH-T building that I'm sure many people will enjoy as there isn't much IH-T industrial stock to choose from on the exchanges.*
