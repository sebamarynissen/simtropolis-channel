    **NAB Hobart, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A request from a fellow SC4 player, NAB Hobart is a slim-line 14 floor mid-rise (or high-rise depending on your point of view) mid-twentieth century building from downtown Hobart, Australia.

    So typical of the mid-century design, the main tower part of the building sits atop a wider podium level with exposed columns at both transition areas to lend a 'lightness' of contruction quality to the design. Another piece in the playbook of modernist style is the wall sculpture that adorns the main entrance. Vertical concrete and metal fins help visually lengthen the building.

    I have taken some liberties with the building. Most notably, in real life the large blank wall area of the tower actually faces the street and the windowed wall faces other builidngs. I found that highly peculiar, so swapped that odd detail around to make this a much more traditional W2W building.

    It is offered as a growable only CS§§§ 2x1 and CO§§§ 1x2 covering both corner lots.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
