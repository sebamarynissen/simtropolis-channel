    **Old Timber Warehouses, by Mattb325.**

    At the request of a fellow SC4 player, I present two old timber warehouses, similar to those that used to line wharves and waterfronts in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century.

    There are two variations in a building family (so they will apear at random). Both the blue and mustard coloured buildings share the same stats.

    They are presented as I-M $$ on a 3x3 and 4x4 lot. Use the CTRL key while zoning to assist growth.

    **STATS:**

    Bulldoze Cost: $317

    Capacity Satisfied: IM$$ 136

    Pollution: 8 (air) / 5 (water) / 4 (garbage)

    Radius: 9 / 13 / 0

    Power Consumed: 9 MwH

    Water Consumed: 122 Gallons
