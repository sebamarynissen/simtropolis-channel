    **Diagonal Amenities, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    After releasing the diagonal filler parks, I was sent some images of the 'Tokyo Toilet Project' and a request to incorporate these into SC4.

    Since public toilets are quite rare in SC4 (but common in the real world) and the ones from the Tokyo Toilet Project are anything thing but your basic cinder-block sh\*thouse, I thought I'd bring them into game.

    There are three toilets in a prop family, so you will get something different each time you plop (no pun intended).

    These parks are made as over-hanging props. The lot size is 1x1 and the overhang allows you to cover diagonal/ortho transitions. These parks should not be used on sloping ground. They use the standard Maxis white pavement and have a basic park effect.

    Please  note, that like all of these sorts of overhanging/filler pieces (not just mine, but everyone's), there are various visual glitches where they meet the ground, or network pieces or even other lots. These glitches can be minor or major depending on your video card, shadow settings, placement on the map, etc, etc. Unfortunately I can't do anything about it: I made my peace with the various visual glitches of this old game years ago.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
