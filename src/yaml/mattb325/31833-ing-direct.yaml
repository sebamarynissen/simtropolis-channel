    **ING Direct, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A high wealth, 14 storey office (CO§§§) typical of the 1990s style, it is inspired by an office in Sydney. It has typical features of the late 1990s: polished stone veneer feature cladding over concrete pre-cast walls; double height, off-set colonnaded forecourt; a curved central window feature and arched entrance-way; mixed materials and a small balcony for the executive offices.

    It is offered as a growable lot as a 3x2 and 3x3. It grows on all tilesets on medium and high density lots.   
    Having reasonably similar statistics to the ingame Hourvitz Accounting, Ajjanagadde Inc, Goldman Building and Walton Plaza, it should offer some competition for these Maxis buildings.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    This lot does not require external dependencies.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **NOTE ABOUT PARKING TEXTURES:**

    As this model contains garaged underground parking - typical of Sydney offices, a garage door fronts the street - the lots do not come with parking textures. If you wish to add acres of parking or change the concrete textures, please use the lot editor to do so.

    To install, simply unzip the contents of this file into your plugins folder.
