    **Chinatown Road, Avenue and Pedestrian Lane Canopies, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    One of the things that is quite difficult to achieve in SC4 is roads and areas of a city tile that convey a 'sense of place'. In almost all cities and large towns the main shopping streets, cultural precincts and prominent thoroughfares usually have their own immediately recognisable style; whether it is from architecture or street trees and street furniture.

    That is the genesis behind this series of canopies: to denote a stronger sense of place at street level while being functional.

    This first set of canopies is based on the typical displays of red Chinese lanterns, dragon imagery and symbols that are found in the so-called 'Chinatown' areas of cities. The red lanterns cast a striking glow at night, the canopy is made in such a way to enable moving sims and automata to be visible through the bracing and your street lights and street props will also be visible underneath the canopy.

    There are 3 lots in this download, and each is functional.

    \* A road-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 1x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to each other all along the roadway;  
    \* An avenue-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 2x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to each other all along the avenue;  
    \* A functional pedestrian-only laneway. This lot is 1x4 tiles long and must be joined to the road/street network and/or the NAM ped-mall pieces.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS:**

    \* While road-top/avenue-top bus stops can be safely placed next to a commercial building without any issues, they cannot be placed adjacent to a residential lot or you will get a no-car-zot. This is  limitation of the game and I cannot do anything about this. The exception to this rule is where the residential lot is wider than the road-top bus stop: so for instance, if you place a 1x1 road-top bus stop next to a 4x4 apartment block, the apartment block will be fine, but if it is next to a 1x2 row house, then the row house will abandon because of no car access.

    \* The functional pedestrian laneway is NOT a ped-mall; it is simply a pedestrian enabled lot. If you connect two of these lots directly together, SIMs will be unlikely to cross them (that is why a ped-mall piece is used to connect lots).

    **\---------------------------------------**

    The bus stops are found in the misc transit menu and have a capacity of 50,000 (and support all types of vehicles: pedestrian, bus, car, freight). The pedestrian laneway is found in the Landmark menu and provides a few jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
