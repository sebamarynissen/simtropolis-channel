    **Retro Tower, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A mightily ugly relic from the late 1970's, Retro Tower (*name changed to protect the identity of the real building*), has all of the highly fashionable hallmarks of that era: bronze-tinted, rounded windows with extruded surrounds, buttressed external columns that taper at the top in a feeble attempt to give an otherwise dumpy little 10-story building the graceful look of a rocket ship about to take flight.

    While back in its heyday, it would have had top tenants such as Polaroid, these days it probably just houses a telemarketing call centre.

    This building is offered as a growable medium-wealth commercial officemid-rise building on all tilesets. It grows on a 3x2 or 3x3 lot. It has been modded to grow relatively infrequently, so the average user shouldn't see this taking over their cities. But just as in real life, not everything is a prom queen beauty, this sort of architecture helps lend a bit of gritty realism to SC4.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must choose only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod: ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    Something this ugly is *actually enhanced* by the Maxis props and as such requires no dependencies.

    To install, simply unzip the file into your plugins folder.
