  summary: Pigs Ass Porter Brewing Co
  description: |-
    **Pigs Ass Porter Brewing Co. by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This Brewery building is fictional, but the beer - "Pigs Ass Porter" is *real*: an award winning London-style dark ale.

    Even though the building is fictional, these sorts of solidly constructed brick factories were common-place in the early 20th Century.  This I-M building is highly detailed and, unlike many I-M buildings, does not wear the pastiche of run-down rusty griminess, so will look just as good in an industrial wasteland as it would in at the edge of an urban core.

    The building is offered as an I-M 4x4 and 5x5 growable Anchor lot. If you wish to make this building ploppable, I would suggest downloading Buggis Extra Cheats.

    It is suited to CAM and non-CAM cities alike and provides 639 jobs.

    Additionally, the little beer truck is provided as a separate prop.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
