    **Bade Rd Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This modern apartment block from Taiwan was made as a request.

    While this 15 story apartment may seem conventional at the front with two-toned render and curved balconies, the side elevation features tetris-like, multi-toned panels which hide the more mundane aspects of apartment construction such as kitchen and bathroom windows.

    In the real life version, these panels are quite pronounced, but I have pared them back for SC4. There is also a communal rooftop garden to give your cities a bit of green-space feeling.

    In game, these apartments house 404 medium wealth sims.

    They grow on a 2x2 left-hand corner lot on the Houston tileset only.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    Stats below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
