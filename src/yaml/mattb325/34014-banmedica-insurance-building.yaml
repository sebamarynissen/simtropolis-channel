    **Banmedica Insurance, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This unusually shaped skyscraper was first posted in the BAT request thread.

    The Banmedica Health Insurance building (*Torre Banmedica*) is located in Las Condes, Santiago. I liked the unusual shapes and massing of this modernist building as well as the eye-catching brise-soleil that grace an entire elevation and exentuate the curve of the building.

    It is offered as a high wealth, high density Commercial Offices Building on a 4x4 corner lot. This should help ensure that it doesn't become too weedy...but weediness of course depends on what else you have in your plugins.

    It grows on all tilesets and employs 2,229 sims. It is suitable for CAM and non-CAM cities alike.

    If you want to make this a ploppable, I would suggest using Buggis extra cheats which will enable you to select this (and indeed any other building in your plugins - including maxis content) from a drop down list.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
