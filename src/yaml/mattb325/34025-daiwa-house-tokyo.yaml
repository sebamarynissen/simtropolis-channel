    **Daiwa House, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This detailed skyscraper first appeared as an unfinished project in the 'Ones That Never Made It To The STEX' thread.

    Daiwa House is a smaller skyscraper located in Tokyo that used to house the Japan Rail Freight offices.

    I liked the various forecourt and pedestrian/underground parking space areas, and I have also given the podium roof a green-space treatment (this area of the  building has a more Japanese style "karesansui" garden, but raked pebbles and little stones won't work at the small SC4 scale) that makes the building equally suited to either Japanese-styled cities or Western-styled ones.

    It should also complement the series of other Japanese buildings I have made.

    The building is offered as a high wealth, high density Commercial Offices Building on a 4x4 lot.

    It grows on all tilesets and employs 2,255 sims. It is suitable for CAM and non-CAM cities alike.

    If you want to make this a ploppable, I would suggest using Buggis extra cheats which will enable you to select this (and indeed any other building in your plugins - including maxis content) from a drop down list.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
