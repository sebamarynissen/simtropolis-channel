    **Hungry Jacks, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Hungry Jacks is the franchised Australian version of the better-known American Burger King.

    In 1971 the parent company Pillsbury provided franchisee Jack Cowin with a list of names that the company had already trademarked, and he choose Hungry Jack (the name of Pillsbury's pancake mix).

    Hungry Jacks and Burger King have often had a fraught relationship and during the late 1990's were embroiled in a five year court battle. Australia has the most complex corporate governance, tort and contract laws in the world, and despite Burger King's massive legal clout, they lost their case and decided to terminate their operations in Australia and transferred the Hungry Jacks assets to their New Zealand franchise group under a master Franchise Agreement.

    Hungry Jacks has been operating nationally ever since.

    This BAT represents their newer style of restaurant. Angled walls and 45 degree car-parking help break up the grid.

    This is a CS$$ bat that will grow early on in your cities development stage provided you have sufficient demand. It provides 29 jobs. If you have downloaded my McDonalds restaurant, then the Hungry Jacks will compete on similar lot sizes (just like in real life).

    It comes in three diferent lot sizes: 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 (all are corner lots only).

    It grows on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one is for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos or Mashty's night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must select and install only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
