    **SAKS Fifth Ave Wilshire Blvd Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Located at 9600 Wilshire Boulevard in L.A, this building was completed in 1937 as a luxury department store for SAKS Fifth Avenue.

    The original art-deco building has undergone many renovations and enlargements. The present building has had all of its windows painted over (yuck), so I have taken liberties in that regard.

    It is offered as a growable high-wealth commercial services (CS$$$) building only - on all tilesets and for all densities. Being relatively low-rise and with a large parking lot, it is designed to work just as well in a downtown setting as it is on a suburban avenue.

    Use the CTRL key while zoning to assist growth or download buggis extra cheats if you want to turn this into a ploppable building.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
