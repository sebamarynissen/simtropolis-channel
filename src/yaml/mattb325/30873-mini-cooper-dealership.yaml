    **Mini Cooper Dealership, by Mattb325.**  
    \---------------------------------------

    The new Mini Cooper dealerships certainly are eye-catching. Clad in dark Aluminium Composite Material panelling punctuated with brushed steel window frames and coloured, plastic-coated display boxes drawing the eye to the oh-so-trendy cars within.

    The showrooms are soaring internal spaces (quite the opposite of the car!) often extending three or four floors. These large showrooms really are designed to be signature spaces for urban environments. But work equally well out in suburbia.

    This lot is offered as a 6x4 and 6x6 high-wealth C$$$ lot. The 6x4 lot is also ploppable.

    Use the control key while zoning to assist in getting the 6x4 size and 6x6 sizes. The 6x4 lot may be broken up by the game if insufficient CS$$$ demand exists: hence the reason for including a 6x4 Ploppable with Jobs.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
