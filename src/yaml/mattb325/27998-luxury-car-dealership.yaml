    **Luxury Car Dealership, by Mattb325.**

    I always quite liked the Maxis luxury car dealership, but at just 15 jobs was just too small to offer any real benefits for city growth.

    Additionally in real life, over the last few years car sales show rooms have moved away from the basic lot, to quite elaborate and funky purpose built show rooms and dealerships.

    I originally made this BAT for my own use as a generic low-growth stage filler lot suitable for suburban high streets and other main thoroughfares where some high wealth CS jobs are needed. It has a striking modern design, and features a curved glass wall double-height show room fronting the street. Like almost every car dealership I have ever seen (even in cooler climates), it even has the obligatory palm trees as part of the lot ![:uhm:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_41.gif)

    This lot provides 58 CS$$$ jobs.

    This lot is a 4x4 corner lot and grows freely (without being weedy). Use the control key while zoning to assist in getting the 4x4 size. An additional benefit of having a 4x4 lot is that as your city grows, its footprint can easily upgrade.

    **STATS:**

    Growth Stage: 1 (low/medium and high density zones)

    Bulldoze Cost: $189

    Capacity Satisfied: CS$ 550, CS$$ 140, CS$$$ 58

    Pollution: 3 (Air)/ 2 (Water)/ 4 (Garbage )

    Pollution Radius: 6/7/0

    Building Style: Chicago/NY/Houston/Euro
