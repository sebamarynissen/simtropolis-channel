    **Aero Department Store, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    An example of high street commercial buildings which have had a major facade update, Aero department store is a five floor luxury department store.

    The facade has been clad in a decorative gold screen with a modern and eye-catching floral motif.

    It is offered as a growable medium wealth commercial services and commercial offices building on a 4x3 (more suited to urban set-ups) and a 6x6 lot suited to suburban areas. To avoid weediness, it grows on the modern Houston and Euro Tilesets.

    If you wish to make this ploppable, I suggest downloading Buggis extra cheats which will make this (and everything else in your plugins) available to plop from a drop-down list.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
