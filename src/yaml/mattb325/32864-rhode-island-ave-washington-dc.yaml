    **Rhode Island Avenue Washington DC, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    I'm always on the look-out for corner W2W buildings that have a bit more visual massing and layers than just a box with windows on two corner sides.

    This is just such a building that was inspired by one on Rhode Island Avenue in Washington DC. It is a 9 story building with basement parking, but the two 8 story projections and the angled entrance foyer help to break up the facade rather nicely. With its alternative stacked pale brick walls, it is also a total 1970's relic, which is still somewhat lacking in game.

    The building is offered in two different formats for corner lots.

    1) A CS§§ growable on a 2x2 lot providing 239 jobs.

    2) A CO§§ growable on a 2x2 lot providing 764 jobs.

    The CO and CS are rotated differently so that both corners are covered.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    If you use the dark nite version (select the file with the 'DN' suffix), you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. (the file with the 'MN' suffix)
