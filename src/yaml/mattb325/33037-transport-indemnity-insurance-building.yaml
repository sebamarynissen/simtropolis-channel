    **Transport Indemnity Insurance Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This little building comes from old Los Angeles.

    Long since demolished, The Transport Indemnity Office once stood on Wilshire Blvd and is a great example of a confident mid-century modern style applied to a low-set purpose built regional office building.

    For those not old enough to remember, before computers came along all large companies, government services and insurance agencies needed to have many smaller buildings in order to serve a set number of people within any given radius: the only link to a head office was by telephone, and later, telex/facsimile.

    Of course with the advent of computer technology, all such smaller offices were able to be centralised meaning most of these sorts of buildings were left empty as they were too small to be repurposed. Furthermore, given the shaky ground of L.A., retrofitting such small buildings for earthquakes was often too costly, so they were simply demolished.

    A number of lot variations are provided: 3x3, 3x2 and 2x3. This Medium Wealth CO building grows on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
