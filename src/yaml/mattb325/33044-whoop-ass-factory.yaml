    **Whoop Ass Factory, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    While the product, "Whoop Ass" Hot Steak Sauces are real, this Factory BAT is purely fictional.

    Even though the building draws inspiration from real life food manufacturing factories and with its attached office/showroom is completely plausible, the building is not meant to be a 'serious' creation, but a bit of fun....more along the lines of, and in the same vein as, Simgoober's Fukitol Factory.

    SC4 is a game, after all. ![*:ohyes:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_29.gif "*:ohyes:")

    This is an I-M Anchor for an 8x8 lot. To help get it (and other MEGA industrial lots) to grow, use the CTRL key while zoning, or just make it ploppable by downloading Buggis extra cheats.

    It is suitable for CAM and non-CAM players alike.

    I have modded it so that it shouldn't grow like a weed...however that depends on what else you have in your plugins to compete with these large I-M lots.

    Some folks might consider a good song to accompany this bat would be Johnny Cash: "The Ring of Fire".

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
