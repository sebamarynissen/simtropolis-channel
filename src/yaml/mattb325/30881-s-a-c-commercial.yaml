    **S.A.C. Commercial Building, by Mattb325.**  
    \---------------------------------------

    Back in 2005 when I first started batting, user S.A.C. (an amazing lot-maker and author of the legendary CJ *'Olympia'*) posted some pictures of SC3URK buildings to inspire batters.

    I saved a few of these pictures to my hard-drive: S.A.C. had an amazing eye for detail in SC3 & SC4 and it is nice to be able to add one of her Sim City 3000 inspirations to Sim City 4 all these years later.

    This building is a very loose interpretation of the SC3URK artwork that S.A.C. displayed.

    'S.A.C. Commercial' is a 24-floor tower with a shopping mall at the base and offices above the 6th floor podium.

    It sits on quite a tight lot: 3x2 and 3x3 as both a high-wealth commercial services (CS§§§) and commercial offices (CO§§§) offering.

    It is a growable mid-rise building only and grows on all tilesets. It competes well with many of the Maxis mid-rises.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
