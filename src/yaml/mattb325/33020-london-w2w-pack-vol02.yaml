    **London W2W Pack Vol02, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This download contains nine Wall to Wall buildings from inner city London.

    These are all real buildings from around Charterhouse St and take in a huge variety of architectural styles: art deco, art nouveau, early, mid & late victorian, gothic, palladian and edwardian. What these buildings all have in common is that they are primarily centred around night-time activities...restaurants, bars and night-clubs.

    All these buildings area highly detailed with lots of visual interest, they will work equally well in a London themed city or anywhere you want a lively main street that isn't a typical skyscraper jungle. There are also two corner W2W buildings offered and cover both corners.

    The buildings are all offered as CS§§/CS§§§ growable on the following lot sizes: 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 for medium and high-density zones providing numerous jobs. If you want these as a ploppable, I suggest downloading Buggis Extra Cheats which will enable you to plop these as fully functioning lots.

    All the lots grow at stages 4 & 5.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
