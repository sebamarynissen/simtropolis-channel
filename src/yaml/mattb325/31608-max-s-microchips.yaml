    **Max's Microchips, by Mattb325.**  
    **\---------------------------------------**

    As part of providing some much needed, long overdue upgrades to some of the Maxis I-HT stalwarts, I decided that Max's Microchips deserved a new 're-imaging' for the 21st Century. Please note that this doesn't interfere with the original Maxis files and will also work for those who have a Maxis blocker installed.

    This I-HT Anchor lot comes in two flavours: 6x6 and 8x8 (*use the CTRL Key while zoning to ensure that you get the correct lot size*).

    It is growable only on medium and high density Industrial zones and provides 1,184 jobs.

    The building itself is strictly fictional; although I drew inspiration from the some of the Industrial developments that are springing up in SE Asia where large areas of the building activity and function are contained underground. This is one such building as evidenced by the sloping driveway and reflective pond covered roof punctuated by air intake vents.

    The two floors visible from street level are for office and reception space.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either:
