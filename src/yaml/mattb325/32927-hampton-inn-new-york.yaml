    **Hampton Inn New York, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This high-rise hotel fills a gap in the paucity of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any additional growth at all.

    This building is inspired by the Hampton Inn Hotel on W35th Street near Macys next to the Hilton Garden Inn that I have just released. It is a basic New York 20th Century high rise box: brick construction, aluminium windows and a recent 'renovation' by the Hilton group (the Hilton owns both buildings) has given it decorative chequer-board style metal boxes along the street facade.

    In reality it is a tall W2W building with two blank brick walls on either side (yuck) so I have given the building windows on both sides. If this is the 'Hamptons', well, I think I'd prefer to camp out at the New Jersey turnpike.

    In the pictures I have shown adjacent to the Hilton Garden Inn: it is the smaller red brick building.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 1x1 and 1x2 high-density lot providing 151 jobs. It grows only on the New York Tileset so shouldn't become too weedy. If you want this as a ploppable, I recommend downloading buggis extra cheats and then selecting it via the 'buildingplop' option.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
