    **Havoc Bioenhancements, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    As part of providing some much needed, long overdue upgrades to some of the Maxis I-HT stalwarts, I decided that Havoc Bioenhancements deserved a new 're-imaging' for the 21st Century. After all, the in-game structure that has been filling up any I-HT zone for almost 15 years does not reflect its grandiose name, so it is probably overdue for a facelift and some rebranding.

    Please note that this new file doesn't interfere with the original Maxis files and will work for those who have a Maxis blocker installed.

    This I-HT Anchor lot comes in two flavours: 5x5 and 8x8 (use the CTRL Key while zoning to ensure that you get the correct lot size).

    It is growable only on medium and high density Industrial zones and provides between 468 and 1,120 jobs (depending on the lot size).

    The building itself is fictional, but draws inspiration from the typically cheap, prefabricated modern aesthetic.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod.
