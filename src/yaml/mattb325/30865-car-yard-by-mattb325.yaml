    **Kia Car Dealership, by Mattb325.**  
    \---------------------------------------

    This building was inspired by a building of a Lexington, KY, Liquor Barn *(yes, a liquor barn)* posted in the forums.

    It is an unusual and eye-catching building, so I took a bit of artistic liberty with the building and adapted it to a car-yard; as there is a distinct lack of these in SC4.

    This lot is offered as a 3x3 and 4x4 CS$$ lot and grows freely.

    Use the control key while zoning to assist in getting the 3x3 or 4x4 size. An additional benefit of having a 3x3 or 4x4 lot is that as your city grows, its footprint can easily upgrade to larger buildings.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains **TWO** model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot file!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
