    **Diagonal Filler Parks, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A set of five diagonal filler parks to place along diagonal roads/avenues, etc. Essentially these can help fill those awkward gaps when using diagonally overhanging buildings.

    These are all in a family, so you will get a different version each time you plop. There are various arrangements and types of trees/flowers/shrubs and sculptures.

    These parks are made as overhanging props. The lot size is 1x1 and the overhang allows you to cover diagonal/ortho transitions. These parks should not be used on sloping ground. They use the standard Maxis white pavement and will deliver park effects + small amounts of cap relief.

    Please  note, that like all of these sorts of overhanging/filler pieces (not just mine, but everyone's where LODs need to be tight to ensure that details on the road are not completely cut-off), there are various visual glitches where they meet the ground, or network pieces or even other lots.

    These glitches can be minor or major depending on your video card, shadow settings, placement on the map, etc, etc. Unfortunately I can't do anything about it: I made my peace with the various visual glitches of this old game years ago.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
