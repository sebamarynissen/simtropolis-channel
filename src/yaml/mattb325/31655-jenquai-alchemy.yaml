    **Jenquai Alchemy, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Another Maxis Hi-tech ( stalwart gets a 21st Century facelift.

    Jenquai goes from that small half underground building which steps back from the lot (and is accessed via a sort of draw-bridge) to a shiny, new and much larger facility. Just like the previous building which had sunken areas and elevated walkways, this new IHT factory provides a lovely, leafy sunken courtyard for employees to take lunch as well as a raised walkway connecting the two buildings.

    This version is a Hi-Tech growable anchor 6x6 lot (use the CTRL key when zoning to ensure the correct lot size) and will not interfere with any Maxis blockers or re-lots of the original Jenquai Alchemy.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod.

    A NOTE ABOUT PARKING TEXTURES:**

    Sadly, if there appears to be any parking used in the content picture as either part of, or adjacent to the custom content in question, it has now come to the ridiculous scenario of having to write a blurb about parking textures given yet more comments received form only one or two users (*comments which incidentally are only made on my lots - I note that other active Batters use Maxis parking lots all the time and receive no negative comments, such is the double-standard*). Please note that I will use whatever parking textures I feel like on my lots. If you want something else, then use the lot editor.
