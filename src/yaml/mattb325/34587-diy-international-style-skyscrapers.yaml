    **DIY Skyscraper International Style, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This download contains 3 modular BAT pieces to allow the end user to build their own functional skyscraper in the lot editor.

    While there are plenty of modular sets for all sorts of things, to my knowledge, a modular, functional skyscraper is a unique offering in the SC4 world.

    The model is fictional, but representative of the ubiquitous International Style of skyscraper that dominated the world from the 1950's onwards. These sorts of buildings generally did not exceed 50 -60 floors, but some, such as Chicago's AON Center and the former WTC in New York reached between 80 - 110 stories.

    This is the first of a few such DIY Skyscrapers.

    This BAT can be assembled so as to make any sized building (in 5 story increments) of between 10 or 15 floors and, in theory, as many floors as you want.

    There are three pieces rendered out as props that you line up and combine and raise in either the PIM\-x or lot editor (CTRL+up arrow key) to build your own skyscraper:

    \*Mattb325\_DIY\_IntlStyle\_Base (the Lobby and first five floors)  
      \*Mattb325\_DIY\_IntlStyle\_Mid (the middle five floors which you repeat as often as you need)  
      \*Mattb325\_DIY\_IntStyle\_Top (the upper five floors and roof junk area)

    To start you off, I have made four fully functional, ploppable lots with jobs of varying sizes: 15, 20, 40 and 50 floors. These lots are also reasonably modular and you can plop them down in clusters like the display pictures.

    The ploppable lots are found in the landmark menu and provide CS$$ jobs (I've used CS$$ as there is always infinite demand in game, and CO demand often ends up negative by using ploppable skyscraper lots). They therefore require road access - the busier the better, water and power.

    Like all of my work, these are suitable for CAM and non-CAM cities alike.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    Please note that as these are vertical modular pieces, you will see little seams/apparent misalignment/repeated textures at certain zooms. I've corrected it all as much as is possible: it's not super visible unless you go looking for it, but beyond the corrections I've made there's not really anything I can do about how the game stitches FSH files together for its own display purposes.

    And certainly, for non batters, the benefit of finally being able to make your own skyscrapers should outweigh any small visual seams at certain zooms.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    As this is released as a DIY set, by all means make and share your own versions of skyscrapers - you don't need to ask my permission - but ensure that you point to this file as a dependency for your creation.   
    And, if you are using the functional lot versions that I have provided, please ensure that you use the 'save as' option when making your own lot, particularly if you intend to upload your work to the exchange.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
