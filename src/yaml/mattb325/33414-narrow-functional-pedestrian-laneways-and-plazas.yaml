    **Narrow Functional Pedestrian Laneways and Plaza pack, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Firstly, although pedestrian enabled lots are uncommon in SC4, the idea for such lots is not new.   
    However, most pedestrian enabled lots are simply park pieces and often don't function as well as they could.

    With some additional modding, this set ensures much greater use and preference by SIMs to walk through the lots from their homes to work or other mass transit options.

    Secondly, narrow, bustling laneways are an absolute mainstay of most large cities. Before the automobile, many cities had narrow thoroughfares that could only be traversed on foot or by horse. Such areas, packed densely with buildings cheek-by-jowl are rich in character, history, charm and liveability, are often the most beloved and treasured spots of any city.

    While I have made a couple of other such buildings with narrow laneways at their core (the Ivy Nightclub and the Sun Moon Mall), there is almost nothing available for pedestrians that functions and offers thoroughfares of less than 16m wide. That is why I made this set.

    The set consists of a number of pieces, which, if you connect them using the ped-mall piece from the NAM can give you a lot of functional modularity that enables pedestrians to turn corners as well as cutting across lots in the search for work. The set also functions without the NAM installed, but means that pieces have to be connected with a street or road.

    The eight pieces (especially when combined with the NAM ped malls) should cover a huge range of playability options.

    I have created two broad sets.   
    \* The first is the set with buildings and narrow laneways with seasonal trees: these lots are 2x4, 4x4, 4x6 and 4x8. The larger of these lots contain different pathways that the sims can take, so for instance, on the 4x8 there are four entry and exit points which give you a number of possibilities for modularity.  
    \* The second set contains  standard 16m wide laneways in 1x2, 1x3, 1x4 and 1x6, but have a very pared-back architectural style of planters, seasonal trees and sculptures that would work quite nicely to connect large commercial buildings or residential areas with commercial buildings.

    All of these pieces provide jobs, and MUST be connected to a road/street/ped-mall/other network or they will abandon. All of the lots need power and water.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS:**

    \* These pieces are NOT ped-malls; they are pedestrian enabled lots. If you connect two of these lots directly together, SIMs will be unlikely to cross them (that is why a ped-mall piece is used to connect lots).  
    \* These are not a substitute for the ingame street or road network. While commercial and industrial buildings will actually grow alongside these lots and not abandon, they will not function correctly (eg no freight will leave). Additionally, any residential that is zoned facing only these lots (rather than facing/touching a street like in my images) will not function.  
    \* If you force sims to use these lots as the only means to find work, you will find that your residential zones will suffer from periods of no jobs or 'long' commute times. Your cities will still function, but less efficiently, so it is best to use these lots as a supplement to the road network rather than a replacement.  
    \* As the models re-purposed here were all initially designed for the 16m2 grid of SC4, many have had to be pushed together to enable narrow laneways. You will see some clipping in some of the models. The clipping is fairly minimal, but if the idea of a happy jumble of buildings put together in the lot editor offends you, then don't download this.  
    \* Some buildings at the very edge of the lot will take longer to light up at night, or may not light up until zoning, or something else is plopped next it. This is because the buildings were converted to props and this is a known game bug.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    These lots are all found in the Landmark menu. Each has its own unique hover description to enable easy selection from the menu. Depending on what else is in your plugins, the lots will be close together in the menu, but may not be sequentially listed.   
    Please note that the buildings used in this upload are from Mattb325 Prop Pack Vol02, New York W2W Pack Vol01 (either Maxis Nite or Dark Nite) and London Prop Pack Vol02. You must therefore, have all three of these packs to avoid boxes.
