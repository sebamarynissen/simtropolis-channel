    **Sailing Boat, by Mattb325**

    **\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

    A newer, high-end sailing boat to decorate your waterways.

    It is found in the water transit menu.

    It has a transparent base texture to allow the sea-floor to show through (useful when you want to plop the model near the shore-line).

    It requires no power, water, etc and has no monthly cost.

    To install, simply unzip the file into your plugins.

    While I did have to make a lot of alterations to this model to get it to render and display correctly, full credit to the original model maker: link details in the file description
