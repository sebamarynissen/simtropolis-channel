    **Nickov Industries, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This dumpy 1990's building is inspired by a real building in Melbourne; the signage, however, is made up.

    In real life the building actually has the Jacobs signage of the building in Krakow that I just released last week, and, not wanting to release another of the same company, upon further inspection, I found that this building quietly counts among its tenants the Australian offices of Monsanto.

    Monsanto were makers of Round Up.

    Appealing to my twisted sense of humour, these products reminded me of the Orange-flavoured Vodka and Vodka-in-a-cask that Nickov made in the 1990s, hence the signage you see in this BAT.

    I certainly don't want Monsanto logos in my cities, but this building, with its unashamedly pointed Vodka signage, works for me on such a whole of a lot of crazy levels (including others I haven't mentioned in this description - you can work these out for yourselves), that I simply couldn't resist.

    The building itself is a glass and aluminium clad post-modern, ziggurat-style of 16 floors (including mechanical penthouse). Parking is underground and the entrance foyer is double-height.

    Heavy set, squat and unnecessarily dominating over its surroundings, it has all the charm of the MI6 building in London's Vauxhall.

    I have lotted it in two versions. A 3x3 and a 4x4 growable. Both have the same stats.

    The buildings are medium-wealth commercial offices offerings on all tilesets.

    Additionally, the eagle eyed amongst you will notice some new Occupant Groups. Over the next few months, all of my stuff will be updated to include these new occupant groups in preparation for upcoming BSC offerings.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
