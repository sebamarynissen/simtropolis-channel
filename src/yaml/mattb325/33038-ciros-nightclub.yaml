    **Ciro's Nightclub, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Ciro's was a popular nightclub on 8433 Sunset Boulevard. It opened in 1940 and was a favourite haunt of celebrities and hangers-on who wanted to be written about in the gossip columns the following week. In short, during its 20 year hey-day, it was 'the' place to 'be seen'.

    The building was expanded numerous times. The BAT I have made is similar to how this looked in late 1940s: I have added two narrow windows at the front to break up the expanse of wall which doesn't work so well in SC4.

    With its distinctive kidney-shaped porte-corchere above low, curved planter boxes, this building is a great example of mid-century modern.

    It is offered as a mid-wealth commercial services (CS§§) offering on a 4x3 lot.

    It is offered as a growable only - on the american tilesets.

    The building - though heavily altered - amazingly still stands on LA's sunset strip: in the 1970's  it became the Comedy Store and still operates to this day.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
