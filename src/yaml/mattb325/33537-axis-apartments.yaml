    **Axis Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    These apartments were made by request and are loosely inspired by a new build in San Jose, California.

    While the complex in San Jose is L-shaped, I have only modeled one side of the building to make it appear less heavy-set in game. Executed in stone, steel and multi-coloured floor-to-ceiling glass, I liked that the building has a slight bow to the green-coloured glass facade which is also referenced by the roof line. In other words, not just a standard box-shape.  
    At 21 floors, this is a decent sized high wealth apartment block for downtown areas. Each apartment has large balconies, terraces and even loggias.

    There are two high-density, high wealth lot variations: 3x4 and 4x2 which grow on the three American Tilesets.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
