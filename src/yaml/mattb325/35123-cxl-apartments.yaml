    **CXL Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a purely fictional design for an 16 floor apartment complex suitable for inner-city areas.

    I have used many of the base game buildings that I saw from screenshots of the CXL city building game as inspiration for this model.

    It is angled for corners and a mirrored version is included.

    In addition to the single 3x3 lot offered for both corners, the buildings are also arranged as a 6x6 complex (use the CTRL key while zoning medium and high density residential).

    It is offered as an R$$ apartment on the Houston, New York and Euro tilesets.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
