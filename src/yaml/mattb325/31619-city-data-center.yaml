    **City Data Center, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a fictional building, the idea for which was inspired by a BAT by Heblem "*LBT Torre de Comunicaciones Telmex"* available on CapitalSimCity.

    In real life data centers are used for many companies who either **a)** outsource their IT infrastructure or **b)** wish to house their IT infrastructure in a seperate location from their main offices due to either lack of space or for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes.

    I made this little building for myself and have decided to share it.

    It is representative of data centres that are often dotted within denser urban locations: its boxy, heavy set design with raise entry is meant to ensure it can withstand ram-raids and bomb attacks. This data centre will fit into a W2W environment, but also as a stand alone building.

    It is designed for a 2x2 PLOPPABLE ONLY lot - it really isn't something that you want springing up multiple times in a city - and provides relief from demand caps for Res and I-HT (in real life Hi-tech industry rarely houses its IT infrastructure within the factory walls that it occupies).

    It is in the Landmarks menu and functions as ploppable IH-T industry.

    It provides 325 Hi Tech Jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO file types in two seperate folders; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must choose only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
