    **Kyneton Square, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Kyneton Square is a smaller, high-wealth modern mid-rise office building designed for corner lots.

    This building is fictional, and, though made with 3dsMax, I employed the 'old school' batting techniques of Maxis glass so that it could be transparent, reflective, but still emulate the wider body of Maxis' work.  
    It is a striking building with an angled, curtain-glass wall to one elevation. This curtain glass wall extends beyond the floor plan to add a sense of airiness, is a la mode with current building trends.

    The building is twelve floors high and is a good lower-level mid rise building for inner city areas.

    The building comes in two lots: a growable 2x2 CO§§§ left-hand corner lot and a 2x2 CO§§§ right-hand corner lot.   
    It grows on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
