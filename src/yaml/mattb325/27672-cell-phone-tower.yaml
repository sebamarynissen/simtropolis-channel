  summary: Cell Phone Tower
  description: |-
    A small cell phone tower similar to many seen throughout the world.

    This was based on a request from the Simtropolis BAT request thread by LDW2483.

    In game this is presented as a small power plant (it is therefore found in the power menu) which provides employment for one technician.

    As a result it needs road access.

    I find this is actually extremely handy to provide a small boost to the power grid within an extablished city tile as well as giving desirable civic jobs.

    This Cell Phone Tower sits on a 1x1 lot and has values very similar to the in-game wind power plant: meaning primarily that it does not generate pollution, does not explode and does not have a detrimental effect on surrounding areas. Plop, maintenance, bulldoze and power output are identical to the in-game wind power plant.

    A little white flashing light on the top of the mast lets you know that it is working.
