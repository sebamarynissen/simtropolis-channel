    **Car Ferry Terminal, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    While I quite like the look of the Maxis Car Ferry Terminal, after almost 15 years of seeing the same ferry building in game, it's time for an upgrade.

    This is a fictional building which I made for that purpose.

    While the lot conforms to the existing Maxis Car Ferry Terminal, it does not replace the in-game building.

    It is also slightly easier to place along the shore line - if you have ever placed the in-game version, you will have no problems using this lot as the principles are identical.

    Additionally, it uses standard maxis pavement textures (rather than a batted base like the in game version) so the lot will blend in with any sidewalk mods that you have.   
    Just like the ingame lot, this lot is transit enabled for road, and as long as you draw the road into the lot, cars will drive through the building.

    Car Ferry buildings are a great alternative/supplement to bridges, and I use them to ease congestion on the road network.

    *Please note the Car Ferry Terminal is a separate network from the Passenger Ferry Terminal.*

    Ferries that leave from a passenger ferry terminal do not use a car ferry terminal and vice versa. Now, this is no different from the function in the vanilla rush-hour game, but as there are so few custom ferry terminals available for download, it is important to point out. Therefore, I recommend placing this at least twice in any city tile (on opposite shorelines) to get use.

    The ferry terminal is a modern building with a bar and restaurant on the upper levels.

    It has similar stats in terms of capacity and monthly cost to the Maxis Car Passenger Ferry Terminal, but provides a few more jobs.

    It is also limited to a maximum of 16 terminals per city tile and both this building and the in-game car ferry terminal count towards the 16 terminal number.

    Obviously it is found in the water transit section of the transportation menu and obviously it can only be placed in a city where in-game water is present; it does not work on canals or ploppable water. It has been tested to work in Vanilla (Rush Hour) and various NAM releases, up to NAM 35.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO file types in two seperate folders; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must choose only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    This file requires the following dependency:

    **[https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27915-cruise-ship-terminal/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27915-cruise-ship-terminal/)**

    You can delete the main model and lot files if you wish not to use the cruise ship terminal, but be absoluetly sure to keep the two files marked **'Mattb325\_RetainingWall-xxxxxxxx'** If you do not download these, the ferry building will appear to float above the water.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    To install, simply unzip the contents of this file into your plugins folder.

    Thanks.
