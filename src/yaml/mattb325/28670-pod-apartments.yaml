  summary: POD Apartments
  description: |-
    A purely fictional creation, POD apartments is inspired by a recent Development Application approval drawing for a new infill building in Sydney's inner city suburb of Chippendale.

    This modern building, while edgily futuristic, has an element of organic flow with the addition of round-edged and angled fibre-glass panels to the fa√ßade.

    In real life it will sit cheek-by-jowl alongside 19th warehouses and late 20th apartments. Happily it also blends into many streetscapes in SC4 as well.

    It is available on a 4x2, 4x3, 4x4 and 6x6 lot.

    It is designed to grow on medium and high densities but is limited to the Houston and European tile sets only.

    **PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS A MAXIS NIGHT AND DARK NIGHT VERSION INCLUDED. YOU CAN USE ONLY ONE MODEL FILE AT A TIME.**
