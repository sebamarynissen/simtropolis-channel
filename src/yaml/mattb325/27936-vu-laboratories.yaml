    **Vu Laboratories, by Mattb325**

    It's been quite a while since Dr Vu made an appearance in the custom content scene.

    With the advent of social media, Dr Vu is keen to get more 'likes' on his facebook page, so has decided to clean up his act.

    Vu Laboratories is an ultra modern high tech research facility where the staff work around the clock to design ways to turn the by-products of his other evil industries into clean, green, feel good products.

    So far, they have mostly created lines of cosmetics and are now busy seeking the cast of Twilight to endorse their latest miracle cream.
