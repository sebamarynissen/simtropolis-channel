    **8730 Wilshire Blvd, Beverly Hills, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This unusually shaped corner building is from Wilshire Blvd Los Angeles.

    This 6-floor building is suitable for W2W (wall to Wall) environments and the angular entrance wall and circular corner details help break up the boxiness typically associated with such street-scapes.

    It is offered as a growable medium wealth commercial services and commercial offices building on a 1x2 corner lot. It grows on the three American Tilesets.   
    If you wish to make this ploppable, I suggest downloading Buggis extra cheats which will make this (and everything else in your plugins) available to plop from a drop-down list.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
