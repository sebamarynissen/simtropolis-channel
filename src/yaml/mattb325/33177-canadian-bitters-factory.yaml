    **Canadian Bitters Factory by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    When your mouth-hole behaves more like your a-hole and forces your friends and associates to run the other way, then it is high time to consider a dose of Canadian Bitters.

    According to the product blurbs, this herb-derived tonic is for individuals who suffer from '*flatulent dyspepsia, gas and bloating*'.

    The product is real, but the factory is just fictional; however it draws on real life structures which would typically be involved with the manufacture of such products.  
       
    At the front of the building is a small reception area which leads to the main factory and delivery/dispatch area where vats simmer the bitter herbs for bottling and transport.   
    The top floor is for offices and the remaining floors are generally storage/staff amenities.

    The building is offered as an I-M growable Anchor and as a CS§§ growable (imagine that the factory has been converted to a cafe and other mixed uses) which is suitable for W2W environments. The neon sign ensures this building really shines at night and adds a nice counter-point to the bats of other industry giants such as Jestarr, Gascooker, CP, Simhottody, Tag One, Fukuda and Simgoober.

    Both lots are 2x2.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
