    **Downtown Hotel, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A slim-line, 16 story, mid-rise ultra-modern infill building that is typically seen in many cities.   
    Designed with aluminium paneling to the set-back areas, protruding atrium style double- and triple-height reflective windows to common areas and penthouse suites, this building also has a nod to the traditional with raised colonial revival 'X' detailing to the concrete wall panels. It is both generic and eye-catching enough to become a modern classic in your downtown areas.

    The building is fictional and I designed it to easily soak up some of the CS§§ demand that comes with larger cities.

    The building comes two growable 3x2 and 2x2 lots both are medium-wealth Commercial Services Lots.

    These grow on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
