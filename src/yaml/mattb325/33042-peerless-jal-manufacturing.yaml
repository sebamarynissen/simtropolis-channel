    **Peerless JAL Manufacturing, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A typical, smaller manufacturing 'unit' that you find in all light industrial areas around the world.

    This particular company was founded in 1947 and is most famous for making Rust-Off; an industrial strength rust remover. The building is based on the real version in an industrial suburb near Perth, Western Australia.

    This sort of building is particularly useful for when you want to zone industrial near residential areas, but don't want it to look too toxic.....just like in the real world.

    It is presented as a 3x4 growable I-M anchor lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
