    **The Old Market Hall, by Mattb325.**

    In major cities everywhere, the Market Hall has always been the centre of community focus. Originally used by farmers and market gardeners to sell produce, they quickly became a merchant hub where all manner of meat, fish, dairy and other wares could be bought and sold.

    In cities where Market Halls were not purpose built, many old industrial warehouses have been re-purposed as these are particularly suitable given their central location, cavernous spaces and abundant natural light. In real life, Market Halls have a great impact to property values nearby: they offer the health benefits of being able to buy very fresh, organic and in-season food from a variety of local growers.

    They provide large scale, basic employment and the larger Market Halls are almost always a tourist attraction.

    Maxis provided an in-game farmers market designed for smaller agricultural towns. The farmers market provides health benefits and lifts demand caps while providing some R$ jobs. However, Maxis, however, did not provide anything for cities and large towns which was quite a shame.

    So this is where the 'Old Market Hall' picks up where Maxis left off by providing slightly greater health benefits, 250 R$ *and* 100 R$$ jobs, helping to lift demand caps, raising the mayors rating and providing a tourist building plus a landmark effect. To provide all these benefits and jobs to the city costs $50 per month from the Parks & Rec coffers.

    The Old Market Hall building is offered as a reward (which is available at anytime). It **does not** over-write the in game Farmers Market and sits on a 4x5 lot. It is of course found in the rewards menu.

    The building itself is inspired by a building in downtown Roanoke, Virginia which was constructed in 1922.
