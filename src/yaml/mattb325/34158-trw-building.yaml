    **TRW Building Los Angeles, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The former TRW office building in Redondo Beach California was part of the TRW 'Space Park' where advanced aerospace facilities were also housed.

    Part of a 100 acre campus, this 1960's building is classic internationalist mid-century style with an external concrete exo-skeleton. Not many of these buildings are available in game despite their relatively common existence in the real world.

    Even though few examples of mid-century buildings with concrete exo-skeletons are available for SimCity, boxy buildings are abundant. And this is indeed another boxy building. So, to make a little more useful and unique, I have made it a diagonal building: both growable and functioning ploppable for diagonal roads.

    The growable building is offered as a high wealth, medium and high density Commercial Offices Building on a 5x5 corner lot (use the CTRL key while zoning to assist growth).

    It grows on all tilesets and employs 1,513 sims. It is suitable for CAM and non-CAM cities alike.

    The functional ploppable has identical stats, is found in the landmark menu and costs $624 to place. Once you have placed the building, use ped-mall, plaza, park or any other filler pieces to decorate the empty space around the lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
