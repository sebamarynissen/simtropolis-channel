    **Monticello Farm, by Mattb325.**

    **\---------------------------------------**

    This is the central building of Monticello farm in Virginia. Monticello was built in 1772 and was the primary plantation of Thomas Jefferson. This farm is representative of the wealthy country houses that you find in Australia, the UK and the antebellum houses of the US. They are of course working farms, but the architecture is grand, staid and elegant.

    This farm is a designated National Historic Landmark and also on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The farm building is even depicted on the reverse side of the current nickel and at one time on the $2 note.

    The building style is Palladian: its most notable feature is the octagonal dome. This area of the house was designed to draw hot summer air up and out of the house....an important feature in an area which frequently suffers prolonged temperatures above 38C (100F) with high humidity.

    The lot is a 8x8 growable and just uses the default Maxis Farm fields, which I find quite versatile particularly for use with MMP decorations and placing surrounding fence/hedge lots. It is a stage 1 farm, so will grow reasonably early in your city development provided you have zoned a large enough area as farmland.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))

    **NOTE ABOUT ANTEBELLUM HOUSES:**

    Antebellum (*literally, 'pre-war'*) is a term denoted to those houses of the confederate states of the pre-civil war period.   
    Despite making more residential buildings than any other member of the community, I have always eschewed antebellum houses given my utter abhorrence for the human misery that led to the existence of such houses.   
    In that regard, Monticello is not greatly different from other such houses of the era: while Thomas Jefferson may have been a benevolent enslaver, voicing his opposition to slavery while as president working towards its abolition in both Virginia and the North, the fact remains that he still owned hundreds of men, women and children and freed but a handful.   
    Indeed this is quite a quandary; but Monticello holds a special place in US history (this BAT was actually a request from a US player) and precipitated the subsequent abolition of the practice in Britain and the US. That said, I have removed the two side wings from this BAT which were the exclusive domain of the men, women and children forced to work at Monticello in order to maintain the house for Jefferson and his family.  
    Lastly, lest the charming amongst you seek to make inaccurate assumptions about me (*I have been called everything by the community over the years*), remember this: Buildings do not enslave people, men enslave people and it still occurs to this day in every country across the globe.
