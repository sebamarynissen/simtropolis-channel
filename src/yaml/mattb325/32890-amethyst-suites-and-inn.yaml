    **Amethyst Suites & Inn, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a fictional twelve story mid-rise hotel that I have made to fill a gap in the lack of larger CS§§ available for download. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any growth at all.

    This design is based on the Amethyst Suites and Inn from the promotional images of SC2013.

    The building as presented is a total **retro\-fest**. A broad, ten story circular tower with multiple projections sits atop a two story podium that houses shops and the lobby. A decagon-shaped restaurant (the height of class in the 1970's) graces the very top of the building.   
    Probably called the 'Promenade Room' or 'Sunset lounge' it is the perfect spot to order a sneaky 'old fashioned' or 'rob-roy' cocktail while the kids splash about in that other 1970's icon, the kidney-shaped pool, ten floors below.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable with two lot variants: a 4x3 and a 4x4, bot providing **767** jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
