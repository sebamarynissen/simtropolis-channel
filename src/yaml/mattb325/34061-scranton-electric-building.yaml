    **Scranton Electric Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Constructed in 1896, the 8 story Scranton Electric Building is a local landmark.

    It is famous for its sign which symbolises Scranton as '*The Electric City*' and apparently it was built by local businessmen to impress railroad executives on their visits from New York. With 1,200 40W bulbs, it would have been a full time job just to change them when they blew.

    The building features copper dormers and a steeply pitched roof, which is somewhat unusual in US cities.

    It is offered as a growable only CO§§ 2x2 on the New York and Chicago Tilesets only.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
