    **United Central Bank, by Mattb325**

    Drawing its influence from a branch on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, United Central Bank is a mid-rise CS$$$ building for medium and high density zones.

    It is essentially a typical mid-twentieth century 'filler' building of the standard international style popular during the 1960s. At six stories, this is suitable for both suburban main streets as well as downtown applications.

    This is offered as a commercial services building in order to help soak up the high demand for this type (*I can never usually find enough CS$$/CS$$$ stuff for my cities*); and grows on a 2x3 or 3x2 corner lot on medium density and on all tilesets.

    **STATS:**

    Growth Stage: 4

    Bulldoze Cost: $393

    Capacity Satisfied: CS$$$135 (CS$$ 333, CS$ 1,323 when dilapidated)

    Pollution at Centre: 8 (air) / 5 (water) / 11 (garbage)

    Pollution Radius: 6/7/0

    Power Consumed: 38 Mwh

    Water Consumed: 36 Gallons

    Construction Time: 39 days
