    **Apple Store Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Located at 367 George St Sydney, the Apple Store is the flagship tenant in this refurbished, 22 floor building.

    This smaller, modern high-rise building is suited to many city-styles. The large, clear glass 3-story apple storefront is certainly eye-catching (both day and night).

    It is offered as a growable high density CO$$$ building which will grow easily on the modern Houston and Euro tilesets without being too weedy. It provides 740 high wealth office jobs.

    Use Buggis extra cheats if you wish to make this (and everything else in your plugins) a ploppable lot that you can select from a drop down menu.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
