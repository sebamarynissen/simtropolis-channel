    **Beach Hotel, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Loosely inspired by one of the base game C:S buildings, the Beach Hotel is an 18 floor tower in the 'Saltaire' building.

    The building's podium levels are occupied by restaurant, lobby and Palms nightclub areas, while the deck area hosts the pool and another cocktail lounge. The remaining floors are made of rooms and suites.

    Decorated with brightly lit neon signage, bright pink cocktail glasses and coloured LED panels, this is an eye catching building at night.

    It is offered as a 3x4 and 4x4 CS$$$ growable for medium density lots on the Houston and Euro tilesets. It provides 373 high wealth CS jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
