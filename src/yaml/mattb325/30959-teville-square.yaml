    **Teville Square, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Teville House is a small, 5-floor building suited to both stand-alone and W2W environments. It is typical of the buildings that were constructed around the WWII era: utilising modern design and materials such as concrete, steel and glass, but maintaining a scale similar to their Victorian neighbours. While the building is inspired by many found on British High streets, I have decorated it to be just as much at home in an American styled city.

    It is offered as both a mid-wealth office and mid-wealth commercial services building and both grow on a 2x2 lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
