    **Coopers Hall, Bristol Old Vic, by Mattb325.**

    The Coopers Hall, part of the Theatre Royal in Bristol was built in 1743 on King St in Bristol and is currently listed as a Grade I building. It has a simple and elegant palladian facade.

    During the 1970s, Coopers Hall was converted into the foyer of the Theatre Royal.

    Given that the present day theatre royal is a conglomeration of many different buildings from many different eras, I have choosen only to make Coopers Hall and I have also added arches to the sides and rear (aka the Old Vic in Waterloo, London) to give some visual interest to what would otherwise be blank walls.

    In game it is presented as a CS$$$ that grows freely on a 2x3 lot on medium and high density zones. It provides 88 CS$$$ jobs

    **STATS:**

    Bulldoze Cost: $354

    Jobs: CS$$$ 88 (CS$$217/C$858 whene dilapidated)

    Pollution: 5 (air) /3 (water) /7 (garbage)

    Radius: 6/7/0

    Power Consumed: 25 MwH

    Water Consumed: 220 Gallons
