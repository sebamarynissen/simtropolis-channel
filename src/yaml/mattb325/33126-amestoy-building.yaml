    **Amestoy Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is just a quaint wall to wall growable building that I made as a test to ensure that 3dsMax 2017 worked without issues. It initially started as a recreation of a long-since demolished real-life building in Los Angeles, but because the main purpose in whipping this model together was to test functionality of software, it quickly ended up as a 'loosely inspired by'.

    That said, with its corner and central turrets and multiple bay windows, it is still an interesting departure from most of the boxy W2W stock available, so is worth sharing.

    It is available as a CS§§ growable on a 1x3 corner lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
