    **Mercure Hotel Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a smaller 15 floor high-rise hotel that I have made to fill a gap in the paucity of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any growth at all.

    In real life this building sits on George St in the southern end of Sydney's CBD just along-side Central Station. It is a 1990's building with absolutely no right angles and lots of crazy geometry, turrets and a roof top pool housed within a protruding section above the balconies of the floors below. Challenging to model, it certainly helps to break the grid.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable with two lot variants: a 4x4 and a 4x3 medium and high-density lots providing 632 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
