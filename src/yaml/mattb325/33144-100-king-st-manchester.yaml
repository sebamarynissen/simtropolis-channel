    **100 King St Manchester, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a neo classical building of Portland stone from the Manchester city centre that is surrounded by roads on all sides.   
    It was built in the mid 1930's by Edwin Lutyens (the same architect responsible for many English Country houses of the period as well as the redesign of British New Dehli) and it is meticulously calculated with each pediment being 2/3rds of the former floor from the obelisks and it adopts many classical proportions.

    The building was formerly the midland bank.

    The building comes as two growable 2x2 (CO§§§ and CS§§§) lots on the Euro tileset only ensuring that it won't become weedy: in my plugins (5GB) the growables only make occassional appearances which is my intention as this is not the sort of building I want on every street.

    I've also provided a special 4x4 library lot containing 190,000 books for this building. In addition to the usual education benefits that a library gives, this library has also been modded as a CAP buster across Commercial and Residential sectors. Given its extra function as a CAP buster, the library therefore has a slightly higher monthly cost.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))

    **\---------------------------------------**
