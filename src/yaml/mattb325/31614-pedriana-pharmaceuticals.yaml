    **Pedriana Pharmaceuticals, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    As part of providing some much needed, long overdue upgrades to some of the Maxis I-HT stalwarts, I decided that Pedriana Pharmaceuticals deserved a new 're-imaging' for the 21st Century. After all, the in-game structure that has been filling up any I-HT zone for almost 15 years does not reflect the grandiose commercial buildings which bear its name, so it is probably overdue for a facelift and some rebranding.

    Please note that this new file doesn't interfere with the original Maxis files and will work for those who have a Maxis blocker installed.

    This I-HT Anchor building is substantial and only comes as an 8x8 lot (use the CTRL Key while zoning to ensure that you get the correct lot size).

    It is growable only on high density Industrial zones and provides 1,079 jobs.

    The building itself is fictional, but draws inspiration from the *Voestalpine Stahl Service Center* in Austria.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod.
