  summary: 890 Park Ave Manhattan, NY
  description: |-
    **890 Park Avenue New York, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    One of Manhattan's great survivors, 890 Park Avenue is a house located in the Lennox Hill neighbourhood.

    In the Queen Anne style, this house was built as part of a row the 1880s and initially encompassed numbers 882-890.  
    Including the basement, the house has five stories. The current exterior is largely unchanged since renovations in the 1900s when the first floor parlour was given over to offices.

    It is currently being restored to a single family, 6000 sqft home with an estimated value of $15M. In SC4 it is offered as an R$$$ row home on the NY & Chicago tilesets.It is slope tolerant.I have also modelled the basement garden area.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
