    **The Nag's Head Pub, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is your typical quaint English style pub, complete with a quaintly unusual name.

    The 'Nag's Head' is a surprisingly common name for pubs in both the UK and Australia.

    A 'Nag' in old fashioned parlance simply refers to a horse that has outlived its usefulness and is quite distinct from the modern usage of the word.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable with two lot variants: a 2x1 and a 2x2 for low, medium and high-density zones providing 23 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
