    **Chevrolet Dealership, by Mattb325.**  
    \---------------------------------------

    All Chevrolet Car Dealerships have recently undergone a refurbishment across the United States, bringing a clean, modern look to the iconic US caryard.

    Despite the use of Aluminium Composite Material panels on the fa√ßade in cobalt blue and silver, most of the Chevrolet Dealerships are still very bland, boxy structures when compared with  a lot of the other showrooms being built.

    This lot is offered as a 4x4 C$$ lot. It does not grow on the Euro Tileset.

    Use the control key while zoning to assist in getting the 4x4 size. An additional benefit of having a 4x4 lot is that as your city grows, its footprint can easily upgrade.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
