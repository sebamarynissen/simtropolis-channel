    **Boaty McBoatFace, by Mattb325**

    **\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

    A simple, older-style passenger boat to decorate your waterways.

    It is found in the water transit menu.

    It has a transparent base texture to allow the sea-floor to show through (useful when you want to plop the model near the shore-line).

    It requires no power, water, etc and has no monthly cost.

    To install, simply unzip the file into your plugins.

    All credit to the model maker - link provided in the file information section (I merely textured the file and made a few tweaks to make it game ready).
