    **Former IBM Headquarters, Stuttgart by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made as a request, this 14 acre campus-style lot is a scaled back version of the former IBM headquarters in Stuttgart.

    These buildings were completed between 1970-1972 and while they look deceptively simple, they are a great example of the mid-twentieth century modernist style.

    The building is offered as a non-conditional reward and is a modified version of the advanced research centre. It does not generate radiation (which the in game research centre does) and it looks best placed as a suburban-style campus (as shown in the pictures), but can just as easily be placed in the middle of a high-rise residential district.

    Being a large lot, I have transit enabled it (which largely negates the crime bug that affects mega lots), but I would still recommend placing one of my police stations nearby. All of my police stations are specially modded to fight crime on mega lots.

    In addition to providing your sims with 2,250 highly desirable civic jobs that are filled by all wealth levels, this is a CAP busting lot. It will raise demand by the following amounts:  
    Manufacturing: 80,000  
    HiTech Industry: 900,000  
    CO$$: 500,000  
    CO$$$: 500,000  
    R$$: 80,000  
    R$$$: 80,000  
    Placing this lot will also give additional residential and commercial cap relief by providing both Park and Landmark effects.

    All these benefits do have a cost (which is only fair). In addition to the $80K outlay, this will set the city back $700 per month.

    \* It is offered as a reward without needing pre-existing conditions.  
    \* It is located in the REWARD Menu.   
    \* It can be placed more than once in a city.   
    \* It DOES NOT over-write the ingame Advanced Research Center (or any re-lotted versions there-of), so can be used in conjunction with the standard Maxis reward.

    Placing rewards is an essential part of growing a large city and region, given their cap-busting and desirability increasing effects.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/) OR (http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php)
