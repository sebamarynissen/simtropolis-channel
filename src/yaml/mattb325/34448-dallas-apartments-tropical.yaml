    **Dallas Apartments (Tropical Version), by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Dallas Apartments are a fictional building made as an homage to the 1980s.

    Sixteen floors high, the design is based one of the 1980's favourite design shapes: the octagon. These are seen at the corners of all of the balconies.

    In many parts of the world, the 1980s saw a resurgence of apartment building, and developers were keen to tempt buyers away from homes in the suburbs. As a result, apartments of this era often had decently sized floorplans. Add things like crazy paving, a large communal sun-terrace and roof gardens, fifth floor gymnasium and residents lounge, kidney-shaped pool and underground parking make this a comfortable alternative to houses.

    The lot size is 5x5. To get these to grow, use the CTRL key while zoning medium or high density.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    This is the tropically-themed version. A temperate-themed version is available separately. Both can be used at the same time in the same city.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This essential dependency contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod.
