    **Selby Shoe Factory, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    So ...... given my 3yr license on 3DS Max 2013 will expire next week,  I spent the morning installing 3DS Max 2014 and troubleshooting to get it to work with Bat4Max (there's half a day out of my life I'll never get back, but it is either that or no more BATs!).

    This is a quick test building to ensure that 3DSMax 2014 works as far as getting content into game: it was too nice to simply leave as a test, and as it's been quite a while since I made any I-M content, I thought I'd share it.

    This BAT is an early 20th Century shoe factory inspired by the Selby Shoe Company in Ironton, Ohio.

    It is your typical mid-size, brick manufacturing building that can be found in so many towns and cities all around the world.

    Today, like so many other manufacturing buildings, this one stands empty.

    This is presented as an IM anchor building on a 4x4 lot. Use the CTRL key while zoning to assist growth.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
