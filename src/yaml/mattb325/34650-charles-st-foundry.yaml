    **Charles St Foundry by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made as a request, this building draws its inspiration from a river-side foundry on Charles/Mill St, Providence, Rhode Island.

    These sorts of solidly constructed brick factories were common-place in the early 20th Century. While most were torn down, some still remain either as abandoned relics or as converted commercial/residential spaces.

    The building is offered as a functional I-M ploppable which has custom foundation walls and is modded so that it can be placed along the sloping areas of a river bank (thus leaving the retaining wall exposed to the water) and an I-M 3x2 growable Anchor lot.

    If using the building to act as a retaining wall along in-game water, just stabilise the land using the single street tile method as I have shown in the pictures. It can also be used with ploppable water or just plopped on flat ground.

    It is suited to CAM and non-CAM cities alike and provides 15 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
