    **Free Light, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The idea for this upload came from a post in the "Can't find it, ask here" thread which asked for functional lights that can be freely placed to provide a lit path through fields, forests, highways etc.

    While there are a couple of similar mods, they tend to use very bright lights and aren't that suited to pedestrian areas.

    To that end, I have made two 1x1 lots: one with the standard Maxis $$ lamppost (which will change depending on whether you have a light replacement mod) and a HD lamppost with a nifty in-built solar panel from the SHK parking pack.

    There is no base texture on these lots and they are modded in such a way as to allow MMPs to be placed right up against the lamppost. They are slope tolerant. They are found in the park menu.

    The lots themselves are completely neutral: $0 to place/maintain and zero effects.

    However, because both of these lights use the maxis light-cone as part of the illumination, you do need to ensure that there is a power source in your city (note the cheat: "fight the power" won't work with these effects) in order for them to illuminate in night mode.

    These lights can be placed a maximum of four (4) tiles apart from each other/another powered lot and still illuminate.

    These are very simple lots, but I was quite surprised that there isn't really anything similar already available, so I whipped these up.
