    **PWN London, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Inspired by the squat and dumpy newer buildings that litter London's west end, the PWN building is a really useful 2x2 building that I made to cap off W2W streets, as you can see in the picture: but it works equally well as a standalone building or in a more typical W2W setting.

    The building is real, but the sign is just made up (based on the initials of one of the tenants in the building...I couldn't resist). It is a six story, red-brick, limestone, steel and glass box which attempts to convey more complex massing by providing subtle bays along the secondary street elevations.

    The lot comes in two flavours: a growable Medium-Wealth Commercial Services and a ploppable Clinic, which is found in the Health Menu and is better than the in-game large hospital in terms of capacity (3,700) and coverage (856) radius. The clinic also provides up to 129 civic jobs.

    For a small footprint hospital, this one certainly punches (some might say 'PWNs') above its weight.

    Both lots are 2x2.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
