  summary: Orchards Corner Sydney

    **Orchards Corner, Haymarket, Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    An iconic old corner building opposite Sydney's Central station, this 6-floor wall to wall (W2W) building has housed Raben Footwear a store catering to goths, skinheads and punks for the classic doc marten boots since the 1980's, but prior to that it was department store.

    The site belonged to Richard Beaumont Orchard, a watchmaker, jeweler and local politician. In SC4, I have chosen to render it out as the department store in its 1920's heyday. I have also rendered it out in a mirrored version so that all corners can be covered. The poster on the party wall is taken from an original catalogue of Orchard's limited.

    Both corner versions are offered as growable high wealth commercial services medium density lots.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
