    **Mullen Bluett Department Store, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles had some incredible 20th Century architecture: no wonder it was called the miracle mile.

    It's been a while since I made a building from Wilshire Blvd in L.A., and a picture of a now demolished, mid-century gem of a department store caught my eye.

    It's a 1940's streamline moderne type building and is very L.A. in its detailing.

    I loved the hanging plants from the upper floors, which is something you just don't see in batted SC4 buildings. Plus, I always like a challenge and as hanging plants are a little tricky to model I thought I'd give it a go. I'm rather pleased with the result. It has a certain retro-chique to it.

    By the time the building was demolished in 2006, in was in terrible repair. I actually remember visiting the building in person, it wasn't called Mullen Bluett but rather housed a few tacky shops, a small 7-11 type store and a hodge-podge of offices, the entire facade was painted a dark red and the planters were gone. In its place now stands a faux art-deco style apartment complex.  
    Furthermore, there is very little reference material beyond what was photographed in its heyday, so I have made most of the details up. The facade, while reasonably true to the original, is scaled down to fit on a 3 tile wide lot.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 3x2 or 3x3 lot for medium density zones and works well as a standalone or in a Wall to Wall (W2W) setting.
