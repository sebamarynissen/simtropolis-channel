    **Green Canopy Road, Avenue and Pedestrian Lane Canopies, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    One of the things that is quite difficult to achieve in SC4 is roads and areas of a city tile that  
    convey a 'sense of place'. In almost all cities and large towns the main shopping streets, cultural  
    precincts and prominent thoroughfares usually have their own immediately recognisable style; whether it  
    is from architecture or street trees and street furniture.

    That is the genesis behind this series of canopies: to denote a stronger sense of place at street level  
    while being functional.

    This third set of canopies copies a real world design.

    As the world warms and the warmth of large cities, already exacerbated by the urban heat island effect (where large  
    areas of concrete, asphalt and other hard surfaces raise the temperature of a city by 1-3C higher than  
    the surrounding countryside) many shopping and pedestrian areas are becoming hellishly hot. For  
    instance, during the 2019 European heatwave, the air temperature in Paris was 43C but in built-up,  
    unshaded pedestrian areas, the temperature was closer to 70C on the ground.

    These green canopies, covered in quick-growing vines, provide more shade over the dark (heat absorbing)  
    asphalt than street trees alone and can mean pedestrian streets remain lively even during extreme heat  
    events. Plus, they look pretty!

    There are 3 lots in this download, and each is functional.

    \* A road-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 1x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed  
    adjacent to eachother all along the roadway;  
    \* An avenue-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 2x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be  
    placed adjacent to eachother all along the avenue;  
    \* A functional pedestrian-only laneway. This lot is 1x4 tiles long and must be joined to the  
    road/street network and/or the NAM ped-mall pieces.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS:**

    \* While road-top/avenue-top bus stops can be safely placed next to a commercial building without any  
    issues, they cannot be placed adjacent to a residential lot or you will get a no-car-zot. This is    
    limitation of the game and I cannot do anything about this. The exception to this rule is where the  
    residential lot is wider than the road-top bus stop: so for instance, if you place a 1x1 road-top bus  
    stop next to a 4x4 apartment block, the apartment block will be fine, but if it is next to a 1x2 row  
    house, then the row house will abandon because of no car access.

    \* The functional pedestrian laneway is NOT a ped-mall; it is simply a pedestrian enabled lot. If you  
    connect two of these lots directly together, SIMs will be unlikely to cross them (that is why a ped-  
    mall piece is used to connect lots).

    **\---------------------------------------**

    The bus stops are found in the misc transit menu and have a capacity of 50,000 (and support all types  
    of vehicles: pedestrian, bus, car, freight). The pedestrian laneway is found in the Landmark menu and  
    provides a few jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This is simply a canopy covered in thick vines which will allow some of the street light details  
    through the many layers of leaves: therefore only one model is required.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **DEPENDENCIES:**  
    here are no dependencies required for this lot.
