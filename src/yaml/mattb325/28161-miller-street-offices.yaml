    **90A Miller Street, by Mattb325.**

    This is a modern mid-rise office building equally suited to dense downtown urban applications as it is more suburban main streets.

    It is inspired by the pared back internationalist styles that were fairly common in the late 1980s & early 1990s. At eleven stories (excluding mechanical penthouse), this building also features undergound parking to ensure sufficient open space remains around the building.

    It grows on a 4x4, 3x4 and 3x3 lot on medium and high density zones at stages 5 and 6 and provides 521 CO$$$ jobs.

    **STATS:**

    Capacity Satisfied: CO$$$ 521 (744 when dilapidated)

    Bulldoze Cost: $670

    Pollution at Center: 3 / 3 / 4

    Pollution Radius: 6 / 7 / 0

    Water Consumed: 238 Gallons

    Power Consumed: 21 MwH
