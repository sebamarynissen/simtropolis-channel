    **Nautilus House, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Nautilus House is a five story building with a prominent sunken courtyard.

    The building is offered as a ploppable library and a growable CO$$.

    The courtyard and walls are angled to help break the grid and, with the ploppable library version, the lot is designed to be placed along a diagonal intersection as shown in the pictures.

    The modern blue-grey colour scheme, shadow-mesh window detailing and, of course, the map of the world, will help make this building stand out in your cities.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
