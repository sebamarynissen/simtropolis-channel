    **PinYin Enterprises Pty Ltd, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    PinYin Enterprises is a fictional dark glass and steel structure, but it draws its inspiration from the massive boom in chinese building construction over the last decade, many of which use characters of the alphabet or fortuitous words as the basis of the building design. This building is based on such a premise.

    'PinYin' simply refers to using Latin characters to represent pronunciation. In addition, the red backing of the company sign represents prosperity and joy.

    It is a 20 story building in heavily tinted brown and black glass. To break up the facade, multiple green-space projections, balconies and a large raised green-roof platform stop this from being a simple glass-tower-box and add much needed visual interest.

    Like most of my work, I have drawn it to a more internationally-stylised centre, so it will work equally well in both Asian cities and western styled ones.

    Sitting on an 8x3 lot, this will grow if you use the CTRL key while zoning, but it will not grow very often (the game will prefer to break the zone into two 4x3 lots), which is fine as this isn't the sort of building that you want growing everywhere.

    If you want it as a ploppable, I suggest using Buggis extra cheats which will enable you to place this, and indeed every C and I growable lot in your plugins (including Maxis buildings), as a functioning ploppable lot.

    The building is a CO§§§ office tower which provides 2,620 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod), suffixed DN and one for the standard Maxis nite, suffixed MN.   
    You must choose only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
