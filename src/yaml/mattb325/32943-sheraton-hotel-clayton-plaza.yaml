    **Sheraton Hotel, Clayton Plaza, MO, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a taller mid-rise hotel that I have made to fill a gap in the lack of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having too few larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any growth at all.

    While not a strict recreation, this hotel is based on the Sheraton Hotel in Clayton Missouri. While Sheraton Hotels are typically associated with more high end accommodation, Clayton Plaza is unusually a mid price hotel. It is currently undergoing a refurbishment which will no doubt make it pricier, and I have modeled the building on a mix of the present features and the architectural renderings of the proposed changes, plus making a few changes of my own.

    Typically if I decide to BAT a building, I will look at it on Google Street View, if the building catches my attention, I take a few screen shots and then zoom to the satellite view. Quite often, the satellite view presents a "what were they thinking?" moment and these elements of the building get cut from my model. This building was no exception: the sculpted concrete facade caught my eye (there are very few of these sorts of buildings in SC4) and then I caught sight of the hideous lean-to over the pool and the semi-open top floor. Truly awful. I've added some images to show what didn't make the cut....

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable with two lot variants: a 3x4 and a 4x4 medium and high-density lot providing 842 jobs. It is restricted to a corner lot to avoid weediness.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
