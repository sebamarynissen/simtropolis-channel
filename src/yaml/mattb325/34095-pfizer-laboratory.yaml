    **Pfizer Laboratory by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    As the world waits for the roll-outs of vaccines to combat the effects of the pandemic and enjoy a return to a semblance of normal life, I thought I would make a BAT of one of the companies responsible.

    There are many companies making vaccines around the globe: Pfizer is one of them.

    This is based on one of the massive facilities in Andover MA (it is not a recreation, as that would take about 40 tiles)...  
       
    Despite being scaled back considerably, this is still a massive IHT Bat by SC4 standards, and the complex angles help break the grid.

    The building is offered as an I-HT growable Anchor on an 8x8 lot (use the CTRL key while zoning dense industrial to assist in growth) or download Buggis extra cheats to make this ploppable from a drop down menu.

    It is suited to both CAM and non-CAM cities and provides 292 Hi Tech jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
