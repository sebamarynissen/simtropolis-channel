    **IKEA Superstore, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    IKEA is a world wide homewares brand that specialises in cheap, cheerful and functional design.

    Apparently, we are all pronouncing it wrong....instead of saying it as "eye-kee-ah", it should be "ee-kay-uh". Who knew?

    This is based on a real building in Sydney's suburbs. The building is accurate, but the car-park/lot is slightly reduced in size by about 2 tiles to avoid running into the maximum number of items that can be placed in a file. Despite this, it is still a very hefty lot of 18x18.

    It takes up a lot of real estate, but it provides a lot of jobs (1,472 across all wealth levels) and a lot of city wide benefits.

    Therefore, it is offered as a reward.   
    Had I made it a simple ploppable with jobs it would actually have negative effects on regional demand for commercial services/commercial offices; whereas the civic jobs provide employment while keeping your CS/CO demand completely in tact.

    Like 95% of my rewards, this is offered without needing to meet pre-existing conditions and does not over-write any Maxis reward.

    Because everyone, even a SIM, loves spending a full day getting lost at IKEA, it also provides other city and regional benefits by driving up R$$ and R$$$ demand meaning that you'll enjoy more city growth by placing this reward.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate download. This is the MAXIS NITE Version, the darknite version preceeds this file. Files suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
