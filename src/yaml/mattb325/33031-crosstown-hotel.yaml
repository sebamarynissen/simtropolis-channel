    **Crosstown Hotel, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a fictional high-rise hotel that I have made to fill a gap in the larger CS§§ buildings available for download.

    This building is based on countless others that you see around (and though fictional, I make no claim on the original building design) with a large diagonal cross beam that appears to support a cantilevered third of the building. The illusion is visually reinforced by having glass infill panels on one side and concrete panels on the other.

    But otherwise, it is just a big, simple box.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable with two lot variants: a 3x3 and a 3x4 high-density lot providing 1,002 jobs. I find these grow most easily on really busy avenues as CS§§like a lot of traffic.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
