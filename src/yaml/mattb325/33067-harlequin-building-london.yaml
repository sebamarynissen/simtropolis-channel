    **Harlequin Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A newly refurbished building from London's Southwark St.

    It is not a strict recreation, but I was inspired to BAT this little building because of the unique diamond shaped windows along the newly constructed upper floors (which was part of the refurbishment sometime around 2010) with their interesting blinds. Such glass/window features aren't very often seen in SC4.

    The building is seven floors high and is a good lower-level mid rise building for inner city areas.

    The building comes in two lots: a growable 4x2 CO§§ left-hand corner lot and a 4x2 ploppable. Both have the same stats.

    It grows on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
