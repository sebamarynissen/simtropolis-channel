    **Griffin Financial Services, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Purely fictional, this building is a nine-floor mid-rise offering that works equally well on a suburban high street or in the middle of a dense down-town environment.

    The building, covered in multi-coloured stone cladding with steel lattice work, has raised first-floor outdoor platforms over the ground level and underground parking areas. Entry to the lobby is on the ground floor behind lush planters. The most stand-out feature of this building is the abstract wall-art which, together with the more complex massing, will make this building stand out in any street-scape

    The building is offered as a CO§§§ growable with two lot variants: a 3x3 and a 3x4 medium and high-density lot providing up to 441 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
