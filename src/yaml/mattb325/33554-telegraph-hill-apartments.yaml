    **Telegraph Hill Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Loosely inspired by a new-build set of apartments in Boston, these apartments are a good low-rise option to bridge the gap between row-houses and other small medium-density development and the taller apartment blocks that are typically found with custom content.  
    At 5 floors, this building is made of mixed materials typical of the modern palette: chocolate brown bricks and gun metal grey aluminium cladding define the bulk of the structure while highlights are provided by cedar paneling.

    The lots are offered in two medium wealth variants: a single 4x2 and a double 4x4 lot. Angled walls and elevations make an otherwise bland little building somewhat more interesting.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
