    **Niche Moderne, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A little over a year ago I made this boxy, mid-rise, modern infill building that is typically seen in many cities (often as a co-sharing space) in order to test making green roofs with nothing more than height, cut-out and other composite bitmaps in 3dsMax.

    Though fictional, it is designed *a la mode* with aluminium panelling, protuding light-box style double- and triple-height windows clad in timber slats, a large roof terrace and a green roof featuring golden sedums and dry meadow grasses to help give this building a 5 or even 6-star environmental rating.

    The building comes two growable corner 3x4 lots ensuring that it shouldn't become too weedy: a high-wealth Commercial Office lot and a high-wealth Commercial Services Lot. Use the CTRL key while zoning to enable ease of development.

    These mid-rises grow on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod - Suffixed DN) and one for the standard Maxis nite (suffixed MN). You must choose only one file - depending on which night time version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
