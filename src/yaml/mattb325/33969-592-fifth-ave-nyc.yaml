    **592 Fifth Avenue NYC by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    592 Fifth Avenue New York is a refurbished W2W building from Manhattan.

    This 11-story + mezzanine building has been through a number of transformations, and this BAT represents its current iteration.

    Initially the Black, Starr & Frost building, it was five stories high in the Beaux Arts Style. During the mid-twentieth century, it then received a 6 story addition and the facade was given a brutalist make-over with its main tenant as the Bank of America.

    Its latest look sees the brutalist facade removed and clad in polished metal panels with a number of ginza-esque coloured lightboxes snaking up and around the facade. The anchor tenant is Lululemon. So now your sims can wear over-priced active-wear. ![:dead:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_14.gif ":dead:")

    Lot size is 1x2 and it is suitable in a Wall to Wall (W2W) environment or as a standalone building. It grows on the New-York Tileset only. If you want it ploppable, then download Buggis Extra Cheats to make it, and everything else in your game a ploppable item.

    This complements many of my other New York and Ginza buildings.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
