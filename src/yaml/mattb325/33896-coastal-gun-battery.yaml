    **Coastal Gun Battery, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Coastal Gun Battery fortifications can be found along many coatlines of the world. Left overs from WWII, these were used to fire anti-ship artillery from high ground.

    This was made as a request by a fellow SC4 player.

    It is a 1x1 lot that is found in the parks menu.

    The lot is completely neutral: no monthly costs and no benefits. It is on a transparent base so your terrain mod will show through. Use MMPs, like I have done in the images, if you want to dress up the area. There is some slope tolerance with the lot, but as in real life, these are primarily designed for flat ground.
