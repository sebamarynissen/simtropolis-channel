    **Excelsior Hotel, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a purely fictional mid-rise, medium density hotel.

    Inspired by the zipper-like balcony detailing on the Watergate hotel in Washington, I made this after learning of Donald Trump's impeachment in the lower house. The Watergate scandal saw Nixon leave the white house, and I couldn't help but see the irony of the prominent zipper-like detailing along the balconies of the real Watergate hotel and the multitude of lies covered up in politics (a truth universal; regardless of which party you follow).

    Hence the excelsior hotel was born.

    This hotel has 15 floors and a stepped, art-deco inspired design. It grows on a 3x4 or 4x3 lot, with a different rotation to provide some variety to the street-scape. Restaurants and bars on the 11th and 13th floors provide outdoor dining for hotel guests and the public.

    The building is a high-wealth commercial services offering on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
