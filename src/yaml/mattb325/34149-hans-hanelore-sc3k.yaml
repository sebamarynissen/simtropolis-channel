    **Hans Hanelore, SC3000 by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made as a request, the Hans Hanelore is a building from SC3000 Euro Set.

    Not all buildings are beautiful, and this one certainly proves that adage.

    With its two toned, differently-sized windows, it looks like two different buildings have been pasted together!

    To that end, I have made a few adjustments in the model (adding mullions, widening and changing the colour of the fins at the rear, etc) to make it a little less awkward in the SC4 environment.

    In SC3000 it was a residential building, but I have made this is a CS$$ bat that provides 193 jobs.

    The lot size is 2x2 and it is restricted to the Houston tileset to ensure it doesn't become weedy.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one is for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must select and install only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
