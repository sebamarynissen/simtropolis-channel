    **Former First Federal Savings and Loan California, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    It's not only "old" buildings that are demolished in the name of the progress.

    This building was constructed in 1959 and used to stand at the corner of Hollywood and Highland Ave, Los Angeles. It formed and framed a famous part of the view from Graumans Chinese Theatre down Hollywood Blvd.  
    It was demolished in the late 80s for the Hollywood & Highland project (i.e. where the Academy awards are filmed now).

    While this is not an exact recration of the old First Federal Bank, it is a good example of the Southern Californian mid-century, heavy-set, mid-rise office building.  
    The beauty of these buildings is sheer quality of their materials: polished limestone with contrasting highly polished granite base, crittal steel windows and polished marble forecourts, but "progress", as well as the need to expensively retro-fit many mid-century buildings in shaky California saw these gems consigned to the wrecking ball.

    To make it a little bit different, I've angled it 45 degrees for a corner lot as there really aren't many such taller buildings in this game and by doing this it complements a lot of the taller angled residentials from Sim Fox, Bixel, HKABT et al.

    This building is offered as a growable high-wealth mid-rise building on all tilesets. It grows easily, but as it is limited to a 4x4 corner lot (there is one for both left and right corners) it isn't weedy. Hold the CTRL key while zoning to ensure that you get the lot size.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod:
