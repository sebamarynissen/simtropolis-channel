    **Travelodge Hotel Darlinghurst, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Another high-rise hotel to fill the gap in the lack of larger CS§§ available.

    This building is inspired by the Travelodge Hotel in Darlighurst, a suburb adjacent to central Sydney. In order to fit this onto a 2x4 lot, I have made a few changes to the building, but it is otherwise a reasonably accurate recreation.

    I rather liked the curved facade which adds a bit of interest and to break up the griddiness of SC4 high rise scenes.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 2x4 and a 4x2 medium and high-density corner lot providing 391 jobs. If you want this as a ploppable, a recommend downloading buggis extra cheats and then selecting it via the 'buildingplop' option.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
