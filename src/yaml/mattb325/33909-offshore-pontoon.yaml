    **Offshore Pontoon, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made as a request for a fellow SC4 player, this offshore pontoon is used for boats to moor in open water. Typically used by tourist boats, offshore pontoons can also be used to moor much larger craft.

    The design is loosely based on the pontoons that surround the *Arizona Memorial* in Pearl Harbor.

    This 3x2 water lot is found in the water transit menu.

    In order to light up at night, there is a small power output of 1kwh per month, but otherwise the lot produces no garbage/water, etc.

    The lot has a completely transparent base texture and the model has custom LODs to enable you to MMP under the pontoon (as I have done in the screenshots)

    *Boats sold separately.*

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod.

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    There are no dependencies required for this lot.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    To install, simply unzip the contents of this file into your plugins folder.
