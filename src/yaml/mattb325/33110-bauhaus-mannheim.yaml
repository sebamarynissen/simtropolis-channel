    **Bauhaus Mannheim, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    With the slogan "*erhalten Sie alles was Sie brauchen, wenn's gut werden muss!*" (Get everything you need, when it's good), Bauhaus is a chain of home-improvement box stores, similar to Bunnings in Australia, or B&Q in the UK, or Home Depot in the USA.

    I was actually looking for source material for the **REAL** Bauhaus in Dessau as I intend to BAT it, and when the image of a box store in Mannheim appeared with quasi-architectural nods to Gropius, it was just so, so wrong on so, so many levels, that I couldn't resist batting it. ![:dead:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_14.gif ":dead:")![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    That aside, this very boxy building itself isn't too bad and I rather like the exposed girders on the upper terrace and the double panes of glass that make the windows look like retro cathode-ray TV sets. It's a little tacky, but it's different and there is not much similar in game.

    Surprisingly, on a 4x4 lot, in game this building is actually really useful as an end piece to a typical W2W set of streets (as per the images) where the layout is back-to-back 1x2 rows: it caps the whole street off rather well. Of course it works in a non-W2W as well.

    The building comes in a growable CS§§ 4x4 lot.  
       
    It grows on all tilesets and in my opinion works equally well in a Euro or US environment, and I always have insatiable CS demand in my regions, so given that this will soak up almost 800 CS§§, that's a good thing.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
