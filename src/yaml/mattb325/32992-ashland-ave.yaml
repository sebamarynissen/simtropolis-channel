    **Ashland Ave Food Court, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Food, food, food. It forms such a part of our lives, yet apart from the fast-food/restaurant bats, there is so little in the way of eating establishments for sims.

    So with that in mind, here is a food court. Seen just about everywhere and certainly in every shopping mall, food courts are a great way to get sims to part with some cash. In these days of traditional retail decline, food courts are actually now destinations in and of themselves, with retail coming in second. Blech on both counts, but such is life.

    The building is real, but the signs are made-up. It is a six story, steel, aluminium and glass box which attempts to convey slightly more complex massing by providing subtle bays along the secondary street elevations. The lower two floors house the food court and the upper floors house office space.

    It is a growable Medium-Wealth Commercial Services on all tilesets.

    The lot size is 3x4.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
