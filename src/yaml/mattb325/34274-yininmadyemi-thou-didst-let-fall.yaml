  summary: Yininmadyemi, Thou didst let fall
  description: |-
    ***Yininmadyemi*, Thou didst let fall, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A simple park from Sydney, '*Yininmadyemi*' is the Gadigal language for 'Thou didst let fall'. This park acknowledges the service of first nations people to the Australian Defence Force during times of international conflict.

    The park is composed of four 7m tall bullets standing beside 3 fallen shell casings. These are arranged on red paving that is in the shape of a boomerang.   
    During the first and second world wars, some families gave boomerangs to departing soldiers to symbolise hope that the soldiers would return home safely.

    There are two lots included in the download: one a plaza (which will give commercial a boost) and one a park (which will give residential a boost). Both the plaza and park have various cap-busting (demand satisfied) properties.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
