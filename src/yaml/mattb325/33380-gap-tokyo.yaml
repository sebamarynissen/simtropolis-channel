    **GAP Tokyo, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a large Wall to wall (W2W) building from the main shopping street in Tokyo's Ginza district that caught my eye. This prominent flagship retailer makes the perfect candidate for a CS§§§ building to help soak up the insatiable demand that SC4 has for Commercial Services.

    I liked the blue coloured glass surrounding the main entrance and the uniquely delicate, and complex, metal screen that has been applied to the exterior facade. I took liberties with this mesh to give it a more sweeping and organic appearance, so it is not a strict recreation but is a recognisable interpretation.

    Likening me to a child, this model was described by one 'batter' as a "simple square cardboard box" as opposed to his "heavy industrial equipment". And just like watching amateur hour, I had a really good laugh at (*not with*) that, enough to actually include it in the descriptive text for this download. ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    Notably for western city builders, I have pared back any overtly Japanese imagery to ensure that this building will work equally well in either an Eastern or a Western styled city. In the real building, the party walls are blank, but I have included windows in this version to enable the building to work well in either a W2W streetscape or in a more open downtown environment where you don't want to see a big blank wall!

    At 13 floors, this will still blend in with older, traditional streetscapes (as per the pictures which show a variety of new and old BATs) and is offered as a growable 2x2 lot for both corners zoned medium and high density zones.

    It grows on the Houston tileset only to ensure that this "simple square cardboard box" does not become weedy.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
