    **St George Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made as a request, these are real five floor apartments from Canada.

    I have made these as growable residentials and a ploppable functioning CS$$ for diagonal roads.

    In real life, they are student/rent-to-own/rent protected builds and are typical of the lower cost housing that is being constructed in many parts of the world to combat sky-rocketing real estate prices which make it impossible for essential services workers (nurses, teachers, police, firefighters and so on) to live anywhere near their jobs in many cities.

    As such these are low-wealth housing, just newly built and have typical lower cost materials: cinder block designed to replicate stonework at the base, brick and fibre-cement sheeting.

    In game, I always keep a mix of low-wealth residents in cities - if everything upgrades to mid and high wealth you end up with demand issues - so having low wealth homes that blend in with the nicer stuff is important. Similarly with folks who use 'no kick out' mods, these will be useful as grungier R$ buildings have a chance to upgrade to these.

    There are three lot sizes provided: 4x4 (restricted to growing on a corner), 6x6 and a 1x3 CS ploppable.

    With the CS$$ ploppable, this is an overhanging prop which is designed for placement along diagonal roads. Once placed, use ped mall/park, plaza or some of the many filler pieces available to decorate any empty space.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike. Stats below.

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
