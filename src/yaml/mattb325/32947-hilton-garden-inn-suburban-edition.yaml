    **Hilton Garden Inn Suburban Edition, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    With all of the recent high-rise hotels that I have made to fill the lack of CS§§ content, I suppose it's only fair to do some others for the suburban space.

    This building is inspired by one of the many Hilton Garden Inn Hotel in the Carolinas (it doesn't matter whether North or South, the architecture is similar along the mid-atlantic states).

    Despite being 6 stories high, with its rock wall lower facade, porte cochere, gables and pitched roofing, the building still has a domestic flair and looks great along suburban main streets.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 4x4 and 6x6 lot providing 440 jobs. I find these sorts of lots are invaluable to reduce unemployment/abandonment in suburban areas. The 6x6 lot has a large parking lot; the 4x4 lot does not and once it grows you can simply place parking lots of your choosing adjacent to the building. If you want this as a ploppable, a recommend downloading buggis extra cheats and then selecting it via the 'buildingplop' option.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
