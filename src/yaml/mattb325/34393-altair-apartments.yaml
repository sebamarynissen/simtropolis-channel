    **Altair Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Purely fictional, Altair Apartments are luxury homes for 1,291 sims.

    The diagonal bracing that wraps around the angled frames (each on angled buildings) will ensure that these towers make a bold impression on your skyline.

    27 floors high, both towers are rotated at differing angles to ensure privacy on all of the large terraces. One tower is also situated on a podium which houses shops/cafes, etc.

    These grow on high density 3x4 and 4x3 corner lots to ensure that they don't become weedy.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
