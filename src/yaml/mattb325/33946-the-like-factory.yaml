    **The Like Factory, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    I recently saw some ads for companies offering to provide social media users (facebook/bloggers, etc) 'likes' for their posts or product placements for money.

    What has the world come to when a 'like' can carry currency and be used to skew data, user preferences, and so on? ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    In reality these companies would use platforms like airtasker/taskrabbit/service seeking etc to farm out piece-meal work in the gig economy to under-employed people willing to work for peanuts (or worse, people who actually think that such actions make a real difference), but my twisted sense of humor rather prefers the notion of a bland industrial unit full of folks slaving away clicking 'like' on old inane posts, old files etc, all day long.

    At any rate, it is not intended to be a 'serious' building but was rather an excuse to make another little IH-T building to compete with Maxis' stuff...there are still so few IH-T lots available. This is a growable building; it has been modded to not not become too weedy.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
