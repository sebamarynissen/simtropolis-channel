    **Travelodge Hotel Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This basic, no frills high-rise hotel fills a gap in the paucity of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any growth at all.

    This building is inspired by the Travelodge Hotel in Wynyard, central Sydney. In order to fit this onto a 2x2 lot, I have made a few changes to the building, but it is otherwise a reasonably accurate recreation. Additionally, despite being a 'sky-scraper' from Sydney, it is bland and nondescript enough to blend in with many cityscapes.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 2x2 high-density lot providing 314 jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. For example: (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
