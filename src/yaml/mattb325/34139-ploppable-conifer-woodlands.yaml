    **Ploppable Conifer Woodlands, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    In most of my images, you will see a lot of green space. Much of this green space is made from a few small lots that I created for myself years ago based on, and expanding, one of my favourite Park sets, the 'SFBT park set by Andreas' which was released about 15 years ago, but still holds up to this day for making large, unique and non-showy parkland spaces.

    I made these for myself years and years ago, as one of the things I often find with large parks is that have slightly 'wilder' areas and this simple 1x1 lot with a ton of prop families will give the wild look without repetition. If you rotate the lot while placing, you should really never see much repetition at all and could theoretically cover and entire map with it .

    While it fits in with the SFBT park series, being highly slope tolerant, it can also be used to fill tricky spots and elevation changes. I use it often and I have been asked for it on a number of occasions, so I thought I would package it up and release it. Thus, it is a bit of a take-it-or-leave-it lot.

    It is found in the park menu adjacent to the other SFBT park lots.

    While it will 'work' without the SFBT park set, you won't be able to query it without the SFBT essentials file as an absolute minimum.
