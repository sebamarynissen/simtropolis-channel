    **ACA Building King St, Sydney, by Mattb325.

    Inspired by an art-deco heritage listed 'skyscraper' in Sydney.

    14 floors high, it was constructed in the mid 1930s. With its striking central tower, the facade is clad in coloured concrete panels to imitate stone, while the pyramid stepping enhances the 'skyscraper' effect.

    It is offered as a high wealth, medium density Commercial Offices Building on a 2x2 lot.

    It is suitable as a Wall to Wall (W2W) building or as a stand-alone building.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
