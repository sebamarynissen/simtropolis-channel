  summary: Diagonal Rail, GLR, Bus and Subway Stations
  description: |-
    **Diagonal Rail, GLR, Bus and Subway Station Transport Hub, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a fictional through rail and subway station designed to provide transport links with the diagonal STR and DTR railway and GLR networks.

    There are two separate stations provided. One is for diagonal rail networks (Single Track Rail and Dual Track Rail) and is found in the rail network and the other is for diagonal GLR/Tram networks and is found in the Misc Transit Menu. The lot size is 1x2 for each.

    The platform area is a large overhanging prop and the railway station also provides a link to the subway and bus network. The GLR station does not provide subway and bus links. You do not have to link the subway or bus functions if you don't want to; the station functions perfectly with just a rail and road connection. The stations also enable freight trains to pass through. However, a bus connection enables sims to use other bus stops on your city tile to get to the station. These are very high capacity stations for really busy cities and through traffic.

    To place, simply line up the station with the diagonal rail or GLR network and plop. You then repeat the process on the other side of the tracks. Or you can leave the other side blank if you wish, either option works just fine. (*Which is why this is also suitable for STR*).

    You can then use car park filler pieces, ped mall pieces, parks/mmps or just plain old zoning to decorate the surrounding area as per the pictures.

    The best thing about these is that you can have the platforms placed underneath NAM road overpasses and the sims will then use the elevated road networks as well.

    The stations also provide 12 jobs: there are underground stairways adjacent to the entrance to provide access from one platform to another or just to cross the tracks. ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **DEPENDENCIES:**

    This lot requires no dependencies, however, the GLR version is rather pointless without the NAM

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:**

    \*SC4Fix: third-party patches ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/)). If you use the NAM, you will want this file as it eliminates the CTD bug that causes the game to crash when network/transit enabled lots are hovered over each other.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    To install, simply unzip the contents of this file into your plugins folder.  
    Thanks.
