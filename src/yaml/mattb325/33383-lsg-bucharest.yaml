    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a modern Wall to wall (W2W) building from Bucharest, Romania.

    The real life version is a strikingly curious charcoal grey and white building with many projections and boxes jutting out from the facade lit by red neon.   
    I have taken liberties with the structure to adapt it to a 1x1 footprint, as this size building is lacking in SC4. Certainly if you want to have competition for the likes of the in-game 'Paull Inc', 'Bain Brothers', 'Retail Stores', 'Boutiques', 'Deppiesse's Diner 'or the '6 Floor Fashion Center', then 1x1 size buildings are a must to break up the monotony of that size commercial footprint.

    At 6 floors (only 5 of which are usable office space; the ground floor being used for a lobby and car parking), this modern building will still blend in with older, traditional streetscapes (as per the pictures which show a variety of new and old BATs) and is offered as a Commercial Services growable 1x1 lot for medium and high density zones.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
