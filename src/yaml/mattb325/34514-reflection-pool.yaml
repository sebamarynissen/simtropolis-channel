    **Reflection Pool, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Almost every city has a downtown area with a reflection pool: a simple plaza with water and trees that perfectly complements the austere surroundings of skyscrapers.

    There are not too many available in SimCity, so I have re-purposed the reflection pool from the anzac memorial to fill this gap. (I also realise many folks don't want to place a war memorial or a park that takes up many hectares of real-estate on a city tile.

    I made the reflection pool in such a way as to give a generic reflection of trees and a building on one side: meaning that it will 'appear' to reflect an adjacent building: in game reflections are not available in SC4 due to its age. The reflection pool also accepts shadows from surrounding objects which further enhances the illusion.

    The base tiles will also blend in with any texture/sidewalk over-rides that you may have.

    Placing this plaza will boost surrounding desirability for Residential and Commercial zones, as well as helping to bust demand caps in each category by 8,000 places.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    The main dependency has two model files in the download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
