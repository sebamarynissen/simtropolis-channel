    **Springhill Suites, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This building is inspired by one of the many Springhill Suites owned by the Mariott group. This particular one is from Utah, but the design is fairly standard and could just as easily be found in any of the other 400 locations across the US.

    This is a little 4 floor building with pool and porte cochere.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on a 4x4 and 5x5 lot providing 292 jobs. I find these sorts of lots are invaluable to reduce unemployment/abandonment in suburban areas. The lots grow on alternate corners and the building is angled at 45 degrees to emphasize this.   
    If you want this as a ploppable, a recommend downloading buggis extra cheats and then selecting it via the 'buildingplop' option.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))

    To ensure proper functionality, make sure the following files are in your plugins. You only need one pack depending on whether you use Maxis Nite or Dark Nite:
