    **Palm Plazas, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A post in the "Can't find it, ask here" thread for plazas with palm trees turned up a fruitless search, so I made a small set for those who wish to give a more tropical look to their cities using some of the amazing custom palm trees available.

    There are three very simple 1x1 lots found in the park menu:   
     \*a lot that uses a prop family of CP's Date palm trees  
     \*a lot that uses a single fan palm also by CP, and  
     \*a lot that uses a single HD Date palm by Girafe

    The base tiles will also blend in with any texture/sidewalk over-rides that you may have.

    Placing this plaza will boost surrounding desirability for Residential and Commercial zones, as well as helping to bust demand caps in each category by 1,000 places.

    These are very simple lots, but I was quite surprised that there isn't really anything similar already available, so I whipped these up.
