    **PWN London, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Inspired by the squat and dumpy newer buildings that litter London's west end, the PWN building is a really useful 2x2 building that I made to cap off W2W streets, as you can see in the picture: but it works equally well as a standalone building or in a more typical W2W setting.

    The building is real, but the sign is just made up (based on the initials of one of the main tenants in the building..., with initials like that, I couldn't resist ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")).

    It is a six story, red-brick, limestone, steel and glass box which attempts to convey more complex massing by providing subtle bays along the secondary street elevations.

    The lot comes in two flavours: a growable Medium-Wealth Commercial Services and a ploppable Clinic, which is found in the Health Menu and is better than the in-game large hospital in terms of capacity (3,700) and coverage (856) radius. It also provides up to 129 civic jobs. The Commercial Services version employs 192 sims.

    For a small footprint hospital, this one certainly punches (some might say '*PWNs*') above its weight.

    Both lots are 2x2.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
