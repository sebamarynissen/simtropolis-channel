    **45 East Ave, Rochester, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Originally shown in the 'Ones That Never Made It' thread on Simtopolis, the initial author has been inactive for long enough for me to whip up my version. I liked the interesting angles and lines of what is otherwise an unassuming building, and besides, I can never get enough mid-rises....

    It is offered as a medium wealth, medium density Commercial Offices Building on a 3x3 lot. It grows on the New York and Houston Tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
