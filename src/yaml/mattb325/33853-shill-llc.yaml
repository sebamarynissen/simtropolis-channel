    **Shill LLC, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A purely fictional building, Shill LLC is a 16-floor (including mechanical penthouse) mid rise building with a curved platform base which gives a small outdoor area along the left-side of the building.

    A multi-level sky-lit food court adjoins the building. The remaining building is clad in glass and exposed steel support beams for visual interest.

    It is offered as a high wealth, medium density Commercial Offices Building on a 4x2 lot for left hand corners and a 2x4 right-hand corner lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
