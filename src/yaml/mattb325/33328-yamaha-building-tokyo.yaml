    **Yamaha Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This is a taller Wall to wall (W2W) building from the main shopping street in Tokyo's Ginza district that caught my eye.

    It is not a strict recreation - the 16m2 constraints of SC4 make that too challenging - but is a reasonable interpretation.   
    I liked the unique, stain glass and random triangular glass addition to the facade. The triangular glass is in front of the standard windows and is a mix of gold, red, brown, white and clear glass.

    At night it makes the entire building look like a dazzling jewel box.

    Additionally, I have pared back any overtly Japanese imagery to ensure that this building will work equally well in either an Eastern or a Western styled city. In the real building, the party walls are blank, but I have included windows in this version to enable the building to work well in either a W2W streetscape or in a more open downtown environment where you don't want to see a big blank wall!

    At 12 floors, this will still blend in with older, traditional streetscapes (as per the pictures which show a variety of new and old BATs) and is offered as a growable 1x2 lot for medium and high density zones on the Houston tileset only to ensure that it does not become weedy.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
