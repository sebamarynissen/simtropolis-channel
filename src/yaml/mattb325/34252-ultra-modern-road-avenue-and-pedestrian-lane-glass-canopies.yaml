    **Ultra Modern Road, Avenue and Pedestrian Lane Canopies, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    One of the things that is quite difficult to achieve in SC4 is roads and areas of a city tile that convey a 'sense of place'. In almost all cities and large towns the main shopping streets, cultural precincts and prominent thoroughfares usually have their own immediately recognisable style; whether it is from architecture or street trees and street furniture.

    That is the genesis behind this series of canopies: to denote a stronger sense of place at street level while being functional.

    This second set of canopies is based on a striking ultra modern, layered and tinted glass panel design.

    There are 3 lots in this download, and each is functional.

    \* A road-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 1x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to eachother all along the roadway;  
    \* An avenue-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 2x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to eachother all along the avenue;  
    \* A functional pedestrian-only laneway. This lot is 1x4 tiles long and must be joined to the road/street network and/or the NAM ped-mall pieces.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS:**

    \* While road-top/avenue-top bus stops can be safely placed next to a commercial building without any issues, they cannot be placed adjacent to a residential lot or you will get a no-car-zot. This is  limitation of the game and I cannot do anything about this. The exception to this rule is where the residential lot is wider than the road-top bus stop: so for instance, if you place a 1x1 road-top bus stop next to a 4x4 apartment block, the apartment block will be fine, but if it is next to a 1x2 row house, then the row house will abandon because of no car access.

    \* The functional pedestrian laneway is NOT a ped-mall; it is simply a pedestrian enabled lot. If you connect two of these lots directly together, SIMs will be unlikely to cross them (that is why a ped-mall piece is used to connect lots).

    **\---------------------------------------**

    The bus stops are found in the misc transit menu and have a capacity of 50,000 (and support all types of vehicles: pedestrian, bus, car, freight). The pedestrian laneway is found in the Landmark menu and provides a few jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This is simply a tinted, layered glass canopy which will allow some of the street light details through the many layers of glass: therefore only one model is required.

    **DEPENDENCIES:**  
    here are no dependencies required for this lot.
