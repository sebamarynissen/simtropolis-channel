#     **Boats for CAL Canals (2007 Baseset), by Mattb325.  
#     \---------------------------------------**

#     By request, I have made available the four recently released boats as an add-on for the CAL\_Goobers Canals 2007 Baseset.

#     It is important to note that CAL made **TWO** types of canals and each looks slightly different.

#     As extra clarification, this download is for the set of canal pieces that use the **white-edging** originally made by Simgoober. They are not interchangeable with the later-released Stone Canal Base set (which has a **brown** edging).

#     Apart from plop-costs and a slight pollution reduction, these boats are in-game neutral lots which use the same stats as the water-tile piece.

#     Each lot has a unique icon to identify it in the Parks Menu; they are found adjacent to the lots of the original canal set.

#     **\---------------------------------------**
