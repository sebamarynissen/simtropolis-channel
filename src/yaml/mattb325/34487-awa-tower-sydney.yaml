    **AWA Tower Radio Station, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The Amalgamated Wireless Australasia (AWA) Tower in Sydney is a heritage listed art-deco building constructed between 1937-1939. Up until 1962, this was the tallest structure in Sydney. That mantle was subsequently removed by Sydney's AMP tower at circular quay (which I have also batted).

    I have made this building to serve as a downtown radio station. It is also suited to W2W environments.

    Like the ingame Radio Station this lot is basically used as a cap buster; it increases desirability, mayor rating and also substantially lifts the demand cap for R$$, CO$$ and Manufacturing jobs (90,000 in each category).

    Given how most of the industrial/commercial and residential custom content available leans towards mid-wealth assets, these caps are usually hit fairly early, so placing the radio station in each city tile will assist in ensuring there is still regional demand for IM jobs.

    This reward lot is offered without the need to satisfy pre-existing conditions, can be plopped more than once in a city, and, most importantly DOES NOT over-write the ingame radio station.

    This lot has the additional benefits of having 665 desirable civic jobs in all categories, it provides both park and landmark effects (increasing desirability of residential and commercial zones).

    It is in the REWARD menu and requires power, water and road access.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
