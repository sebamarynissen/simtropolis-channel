    **Capital Bank, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    An old-style, 7 story ornate bank building for your cities.

    It is typical of the staid and solid bank buildings constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: lots of columns, pediments, ornamentation, etc, all executed in stone.

    It is offered as a high wealth, medium density Commercial Services Building on a 2x3 lot that will look just as good in a smaller town as it would in a large metropolis. It grows on the Chicago, New York and Euro Tilesets.

    It provides 106 high wealth commercial services jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
