    **Bonfolk Hosiery Factory by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This building is inspired by one in Troy, NY.

    These sorts of monumental and solidly constructed brick factories were common-place in the early 20th Century. While most were torn down from about 1970, some still remain either as abandoned relics or as converted commercial/residential spaces.

    In SC4, I have made this building house a hosiery factory, which among other things, makes socks. A large neon sign lends a retro vibe to the building.

    The factory is offered as an I-M growable Anchor and comes in two lot sizes: 5x5 and 3x4 (use the CTRL key when zoning).

    It is suited to CAM and non-CAM cities alike and provides 354 jobs. Use Buggis extra cheats to make this growable building (and indeed all other growable buildings) available to plop from a drop-down menu.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
