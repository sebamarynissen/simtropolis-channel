    **American City Bank, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The American City Bank was an iconic mid-century gem located in Century City Los Angeles. The Bank itself failed in 1983 and was taken over by a consortium of banks.

    This BAT is a scaled down version of the main branch (in order to fit it onto a lot 4 tiles wide) which was built in 1959 at a cost of $2.5M and features an abstract mural on the second floor, very wide, plate-glass windows, cantilevered construction and a quaint little moat surrounding the bank building. Another quaint, but hideously expensive, feature was the electronic thermometer on the street sign.

    During the mid 20th century, it was surprisingly common on the US West Coast for bank buildings to be surrounded by water. Of course, if these buildings still survive today, these moats have long been filled in given how much maintenance they would require in shaky, drought-stricken California.

    In game it is offered as a high-wealth commercial services building growing on all tilesets and densities on a 4x3 or 4x4 lot.

    As for the actual building, after having fallen into disrepair, it was demolished about 15 years ago. A shame really, as this sort of architecture is truly unique.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
