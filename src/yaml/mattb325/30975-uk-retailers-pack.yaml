    **UK Suburban Retailers Pack, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A pack of five UK retailers as requested by a number of people in the community to help address some of the lack of UK/European stores available for the game. Specifically, I made these for rsc204/mgb204 as he is always so incredibly helpful on the forums.

    The stores included in this pack are: Aldi, Homebase, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Waitrose. One of the most noticeable differences between US-styled supermarkets and box stores and the UK/Euro ones is the domestic scale applied to the architecture: quite often the buildings have an entire pitched roof or composite materials such as timber and brick which are more suited to a suburban house. The second most notable characteristic is that existing buildings are adapted and re-used: it is not uncommon for office spaces or old department stores to be converted to a supermarket and I have tried to pick a variety of styles for these BATs (not just purpose built buildings).

    These are all offered as growable 6x6, stage 1, medium wealth, Commercial Services on the EURO Tileset only.

    Use the CTRL key while zoning, or alternatively, use the buildingplop mod (contained in the extra cheats dll: [https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/)) to make these - or any other buildings - ploppable.

    Given how little competition there is in the 6x6 zone and the fact that the game does not readily break up this zone, I have decided to include growable lots only rather than further cluttering up the landmark menu.

    By growing (or plopping) these together, you can make quite cohesive retail parks which look great in suburban areas.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.
