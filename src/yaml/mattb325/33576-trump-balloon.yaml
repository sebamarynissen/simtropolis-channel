    **Trump Balloon, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Made famous by a protest in 2018 during an official visit to the UK, the Trump Balloon depicts the US President as an angry orange baby holding a smartphone.  
    The Balloon has also been flown in France, Argentina, Ireland, Denmark and some US States.

    This was made as a request by a fellow SC4 player.

    It is not intended to be a serious Bat, so if it offends you, just don't download it.   
    It isn't something that I have use for in my cities, but it's a funny concept that made world headlines, and the whole thing literally took 10 minutes to make for the individual who requested it, so why not....

    It is a 1x1 lot that is found in the parks menu.

    It is completely neutral: no monthly costs and no benefits.
