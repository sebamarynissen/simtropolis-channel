    **Party Lights Road, Avenue and Pedestrian Lane Canopies, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    One of the things that is quite difficult to achieve in SC4 is roads and areas of a city tile that convey a 'sense of place'. In almost all cities and large towns the main shopping streets, cultural precincts and prominent thoroughfares usually have their own immediately recognisable style; whether it is from architecture or street trees and street furniture.

    That is the genesis behind this series of canopies: to denote a stronger sense of place at street level while being functional.

    This fourth set of canopies copies a real world design.

    Redolent of flags, these colourful neon tubes are arranged on steel supports, while central planters contain evergreen trees bejeweled in fairy lights. At ground level, bollards add to the bright spectacle.

    These certainly make a statement at night and are great for shopping districts, entertainment areas or night club precincts.

    There are 3 lots in this download, and each is functional.

    \* A road-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 1x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to eachother all along the roadway;  
    \* An avenue-top bus stop. This lot occupies a 2x1 tile and is overhanging so that canopies can be placed adjacent to eachother all along the avenue;  
    \* A functional pedestrian-only laneway. This lot is 1x4 tiles long and must be joined to the road/street network and/or the NAM ped-mall pieces.

    **\---------------------------------------**

    **IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS:**

    \* While road-top/avenue-top bus stops can be safely placed next to a commercial building without any issues, they cannot be placed adjacent to a residential lot or you will get a no-car-zot. This is  limitation of the game and I cannot do anything about this. The exception to this rule is where the residential lot is wider than the road-top bus stop: so for instance, if you place a 1x1 road-top bus stop next to a 4x4 apartment block, the apartment block will be fine, but if it is next to a 1x2 row house, then the row house will abandon because of no car access.

    \* The functional pedestrian laneway is NOT a ped-mall; it is simply a pedestrian enabled lot. If you connect two of these lots directly together, SIMs will be unlikely to cross them (that is why a ped-mall piece is used to connect lots).

    **\---------------------------------------**

    The bus stops are found in the misc transit menu and have a capacity of 50,000 (and support all types of vehicles: pedestrian, bus, car, freight). The pedestrian laneway is found in the Landmark menu and provides a few jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    The main dependency pack for all of these Civic Bats are split into two dependency files; one is for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos or Mashty's night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must select and install only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **DEPENDENCIES:**  
    here are no dependencies required for this lot.
