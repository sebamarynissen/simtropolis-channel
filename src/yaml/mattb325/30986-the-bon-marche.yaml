    **The Bon Marche, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    The Bon Marche (or the *'Good Market'* / *'Good Deal'* depending on how loose your translation is) was a department store chain launched in Seattle, WA. By the time it has been taken over by Macy's in 2005, it had about 50 stores in the North-West of the US.

    The Bon Marche really had its heyday from the late 1960's - 1990's. Many of the buildings went on to become anchor stores for surrounding mall developments. This building is a retro styled department store that was a similar design to many of their buildings around Washington state. Given they were purpose built spaces, Macy's thankfully didn't bulldoze the structures when they took over the chain and the buildings still stand today.

    I have provided two CS§§ lots with this download - one is a 4x4 lot that is great for down-town areas and the other is a 6x6 lot more suited to a suburban application. Use the CTRL while zoning to assist growth.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
