    **Woolworths Supermarket, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A staple in the Australian retail industry for almost 100 years, it is Australia's largest supermarket chain. It also has presence in many other countries: New Zealand, South Africa, Hong Kong and Singapore.

    Although large by SC4 standards, this is an example of one of the modern, modest sized stores.

    It is offered as a growable & ploppable medium wealth commercial services building on an 8x8 lot suited to suburban areas. The ploppable is network enabled and found in the Landmarks Menu. Both the ploppable and growable buildings provide 511 CS$$ jobs.

    If using the growable, be sure to hold down the CTRL key when zoning to get an 8x8 lot.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
