    **Columbia Savings Bank, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This little gem of a building on the Miracle Mile was completed in 1965 and sadly demolished in 2010.

    It was an important example of post-war bank architecture as well as an innovative integration of art and architecture (which is so typical of many of the buildings along Wilshire Blvd).

    It takes up most of the right-hand corner lot: 2x3 as a high-wealth commercial services (CS§§§) offering.

    It is offered as a growable only - on the american tilesets - and competes well with many of the Maxis low-rises.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
