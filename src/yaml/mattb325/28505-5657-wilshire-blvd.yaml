    **5657 Wilshire Blvd, by Mattb325.**

    Another non-descript 'filler' building on Wiltshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, 5657 Wilshire Blvd is mid-rise CS$$ building for medium and high density zones.

    I choose this particular building as it is a really good example of an old commercial or light industrial (such as small scale manufacturing) structure that has had the facade undergo modernisation to attract better tenants, but the sides and rear of the building have been left largely untouched. In this case, the front of the building has been given gleaming white tiles, large new windows in deep blue tint, green marble-clad columns and planter boxes along the fifth floor which is skylit. The top floor space would be perfect for creative office suites, like architectural or advertising agencies.

    Note: I have taken artistic liberties with the top floor of the building as the first cut (which was close to the RL building) looked a bit odd in game.

    This building works as both a W2W as well as stand alone (per the original, I have included windows down the side walls); the bill boards are in families so a different version will appear each time this grows.

    This is offered as a commercial services building in order to help soak up the high demand for this type (*I can never find enough CS$$/CS$$$ stuff for my cities*); and grows on a 2x3 lot on medium density and on all tilesets.

    **STATS**:

    Growth Stage: 5

    Bulldoze Cost: $379

    Capacity Satisfied: CS$$ 240, (CS$ 953 when dilapidated)

    Pollution at Centre: 8 (air) / 5 (water) / 11 (garbage)

    Pollution Radius: 5/6/0

    Power Consumed: 20 Mwh

    Water Consumed: 32 Gallons

    Construction Time: 37 days
