    **Amora Hotel Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    This high-rise hotel fills a gap in the paucity of larger CS§§ available. Particularly as your region starts to develop, having a lack of larger CS§§ buildings can really stifle additional city development. This leads to a drop in demand across your residential drivers and can completely tank any growth at all.

    This building is inspired by the Amora Hotel in near Wynyard station, central Sydney. The building is straight out of the 1990s: during this time in Sydney almost all new sky-scrapers had this weird 1930's art deco/Flash Gordon retro revivalist vibe with vast areas of stone cladding, bay windows, spires, light-boxes, chrome plating and other quite peculiar ornamentation.

    I liked this particular building because it has different details on each elevation. That is quite rare in tall sky-scrapers and this enabled me to make two lot rotations which gives the appearance of two slightly different buildings.

    In order to fit this onto a 3x3 lot, I have made a few changes to the building, but it is otherwise a reasonably accurate recreation.

    The building is offered as a CS§§ growable on two 3x3 high-density lot providing 1,090 jobs. This tower will grow so long as you zone correctly on a busy road/avenue and have CS§§ demand which outstrips CO§§/CO§§§/CS§§§ demand. Otherwise, use buggis extra cheats to easily select this via the building or lot plop commands.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    Select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
