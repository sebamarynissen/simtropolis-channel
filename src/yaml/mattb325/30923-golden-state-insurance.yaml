    **Golden State Insurance Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A striking low/mid rise corner building, Golden State Insurance is based on the building of the same name on 1999 West Adams Boulevard, Los Angeles.

    Because Sim City 4 likes to grow high wealth lots on corners, I have spruced up the appearance of this mid-century gem.

    It sits on a 3x3 lot (lotted for both corners)as a high-wealth commercial offices (CO§§§) offering.

    It is offered as a growable building only - on all tilesets - and competes well with many of the Maxis mid-rises.

    Stats, links and dependencies are listed below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.  
    You must keep only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot or Desc files!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either: ([https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))
