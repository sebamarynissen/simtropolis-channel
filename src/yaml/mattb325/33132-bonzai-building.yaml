    **Bonzai Building, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Inspired by the Bonzai Building on the Asian Tileset of SC3000, this offering is designed to fill a gap in the distinct lack of taller mid-rise buildings available for SC4.

    Coming in at 15 floors, this building is triangularly shaped at the front with a 6 floor cantilevered section at the rear which overhangs a ground floor atrium and cafe space.

    This version is not a 100% accurate copy, but it is true to the language of the architectural style of the original building and this is simply one that I made for myself for a bit of fun, but have decided to share with the community. This building will grow, but I have modded it in a way that it doesn't grow too frequently or often (*as long as the user has sufficient custom content in their plugins file*) to ensure that this unique building provides a counterpoint to a typical downtown scene rather than dominating it.

    The lot comes as a growable high wealth Commercial office (2x3 and 3x3).

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must choose only one file - depending on which version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version. Regardless of which file you choose to keep, make sure you DO NOT delete the Lot File!

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/))
