    **Berry St North Sydney, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    A mid-rise late 1990s building from North Sydney. With its oversized terraces for 'outdoor meetings and break-out zones' it was built primarily to house tech companies and was the primary offices of a telecommunications company for approximately 15 years.

    Of course we all know the tech bubble burst, and now the main tenant is a marketing firm (oOh media).

    The building is 14 floors and makes a good candidate for medium density commercial zones.

    My main reason for doing this building was the etched patterned glass skylight that you see everywhere (the rest of the building was incidental).

    The building is offered as both a high-wealth commercial services and a high wealth commercial office on all tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
