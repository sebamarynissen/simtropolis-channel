    **Edgeworth Flats 22.5, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    I am always on the lookout for lower mid-rise developments that can bridge the gap between the single family houses of suburbia and the high rise apartments of downtown. To that end, I have made a series of apartments all rotated at different angles.

    This set is rotated at 22.5 degrees.

    All the apartments are 6 floors; have underground parking, large balconies, landscaped grounds and a soft pastel colour-scheme.

    They grow on a 4x3 or 5x5 lot. I have also included an overhanging CS$$ ploppable lot which is great for using along the fractionally angled roads that come with the NAM.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)

    **EDIT April 9 2021:** *Please note, (per the comment I made when first batted these):*

    [https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/50916-show-us-what-youre-working-on/?do=embed&comment=1746905&embedComment=1746905&embedDo=findComment](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/50916-show-us-what-youre-working-on/?do=embed&comment=1746905&embedComment=1746905&embedDo=findComment)
    *...that the angle of this building was designed to fit in with CPs overlay textures, and I simply made a ploppable commercial that could be used with the FA2 network. **I did not get the maths wrong as users are suggesting**, I just thought a ploppable that works with the FA2 network would be a nice idea and that I wouldn't have to make a full disclaimer.*

    *No one will force you to download this, so if you don't like it, don't download it. ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif "*:)")*
