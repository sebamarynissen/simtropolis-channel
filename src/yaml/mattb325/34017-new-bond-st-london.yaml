    **New Bond St London, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Originally posted in the BAT request thread.

    It is typical of the Georgian-era buildings that dot London's west end.

    It has a very simple facade displaying the typical balance, repetition and restraint that the later Victorian era completely forgot....only it's not, its actually a fake modern replica tacked onto a series of four or five joined-together buildings that run between the main street facade and Barlow place (the lane-way) behind it.

    I lived in this area of London for well over a decade and remember the old building...sure enough in 2012, the entire Bond St facade was replaced with the mock Georgian facade that we see today.

    I rather like the former higgledy-piggledy Edwardian facade, and will do a version of that, soon (if there is sufficient interest from the community)

    Despite it's fancy new facade with Chanel as the anchor tenant, and because of how many jumbled buildings are all joined together, this one doesn't typically read as a "high-wealth" offering.   
    Therefore, it is offered as a medium wealth, medium density Commercial Services Building on a 1x2 lot. The actual building is 20m wide by 45 deep, so to get it to conform to SC4s 16m grid I have had to make adjustments. None-the-less, there is a lot of visual interest with this one, and it will work well with my other London Building Packs that I have released over the years.

    It grows on the Euro Tileset.

    It provides 58 medium wealth commercial services jobs.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**  
    There are two model files in this download. You must select the appropriate file from the download. The file suffixed with 'DN' is for those users with a night-time darkening mod installed. The file suffixed with 'MN' is for users who do not have any such mods installed.

    If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
