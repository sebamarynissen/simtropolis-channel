    **BRM Shop, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Some time ago, I was sent some images of Maxis' SC2013 concept art as a request and this was amongst them.

    I liked the look of the orange multi-triangular arrangement of the storefront: and, as SC4 is all about roof-tops, something like this yields a lot of visual interest. I don't actually know what 'BRM' stands for (Big Retail Module?)...perhaps you can come up with something amusing/amazing/enlightened...

    This is a CS$$ bat that will grow early on in your cities development stage provided you have sufficient demand. It provides 174 jobs.

    It comes in two different lot sizes: 4x4 and 6x6 (use the CTRL key while zoning to help get this to grow, or download Buggis extra cheats to make it ploppable from a drop-down menu).

    It grows on the three American tilesets.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one is for dark nite users (and other night-time darkening mods, such as Gizmos or Mashty's night-mod) and one for the standard Maxis nite.   
    You must select and install only one file - depending on which night version you use. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.

    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
