    **Oubliette Apartments, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    These modern, colourful low-rise apartments are typical of newly built student housing.

    As such these are low-wealth housing, just newly built. The developer tried to give it a fancy sounding name, but instead of hiring a translator, just relied on an online translator :-)

    In game, I always keep a mix of low-wealth residents in cities - if everything upgrades to mid and high wealth you end up with demand issues - so having low wealth homes that blend in with the nicer stuff is important. Similarly with folks who use 'no kick out' mods, these will be useful as grungier R$ buildings have a chance to upgrade to these.

    It grows on a 3x2 lot on the Euro tileset only.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike. Stats below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
