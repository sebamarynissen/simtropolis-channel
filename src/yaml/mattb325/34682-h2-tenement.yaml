    **H2 Tenements, by Mattb325.  
    \---------------------------------------**

    Inspired by the unimaginatively named H2 Tenement that comes with the base game in Cities: Skylines.

    I'm always on the lookout for 'nicer' low-wealth housing that I can mark as historic to ensure that cities have balanced workers and demand.

    As such these are low-wealth housing, just newly built. In game, I always keep a mix of low-wealth residents in cities - if everything upgrades to mid and high wealth you end up with demand issues - so having low wealth homes that blend in with the nicer stuff is important. Similarly with folks who use 'no kick out' mods, these will be useful as grungier R$ buildings have a chance to upgrade to these.

    There are two lot sizes provided: 2x2 and 4x4.

    Like all of my work, these are suited to both CAM and non CAM cities alike. Stats below.

    **NOTE ABOUT DARK NITE vs MAXIS NITE:**

    This download contains TWO model files; one for dark nite users and one for the standard Maxis nite. If you are unsure whether you have a night-darkening mod installed, then choose the Maxis night version.   
    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. (http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)
